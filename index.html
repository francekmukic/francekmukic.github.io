Prepared by field experts and professionals, these engaging biographies are tailored for high school students who need challenging yet accessible biographies. Ideal for secondary school assignments, the length, format and subject areas are designed to meet educators’ requirements and students’ interests.<p></p><p></p>Greenwood offers an extensive selection of biographies spanning all curriculum related subject areas including social studies, the sciences, lit-erature and the arts, history and politics, as well as popular culture, cover-ing public figures and famous personalities from all time periods and backgrounds, both historic and contemporary, who have made an impact on American and/or world culture. Greenwood biographies were chosen based on comprehensive feedback from librarians and educators. Consid-eration was given to both curriculum relevance and inherent interest. The result is an intriguing mix of the well known and the unexpected, the saints and the sinners from long-ago history and contemporary pop cul-ture. Readers will find a wide array of subject choices from fascinating crime figures like Al Capone to inspiring pioneers like Margaret Mead, from the greatest minds of our time like Stephen Hawking to the most amazing success stories of our day like J. K. Rowling.<p></p><p></p>While the emphasis is on fact, not glorification, the books are meant to be fun to read. Each volume provides in-depth information about the sub-ject’s life from birth through childhood, the teen years, and adulthood. A<p></p>

On the surface, she appears almost one-dimensional, living a simple life devoted to her calling and her faith. Closer inspection, how-ever, reveals a personality so rife with contradictions that it is difficult to explain her motives and purposes. What is the reality? What finally can a biographer conclude about the life of Mother Teresa?<p></p><p></p>In many ways, Mother Teresa defies the biographer’s art. Her life is not interesting. There are, or seem to be, no great adventures, no great crises, no great sorrows, no great turning points. Most biographies of her are so reverential and so one-dimensional, that it is easy to forget that she was a human being and did not from birth belong to the ages. Even a list of her numerous accomplishments and awards does little to capture her inner life. She did not appear to suffer from the terrible internal conflicts, hard-ships, or adversities that often mark a great and memorable life. Rather, her life was mundane and ordinary, and she never pretended it to be oth-erwise. Perhaps, though, her very ordinariness provides a starting point for the biographer. How did this unexceptional woman captivate and console so many that she has come to take her place among the monumental per-sonalities of the age?<p></p><p></p>Mother Teresa, however, was something of an artful dodger. When asked about most any topic, but especially herself, she uttered platitudes and pieties that sounded almost meaningless. She concealed herself be-hind them. Yet, coming from her, these expressions had a ring of truth. That may be because the story of Mother Teresa is not the story of a great life in the modern sense. Mother Teresa was not a celebrity. On the con-<p></p> 
x	PREFACE<p></p><p></p>trary, hers was a life lived on a different principle. She devoted herself to an old-fashioned sense of calling. She worked among the poor of Calcutta because she believed it is what God required of her. She would have done the same work in anonymity if she herself had lived and died in obscurity. It is that devotion that makes the life of Mother Teresa so interesting.<p></p> 
<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>INTRODUCTION<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Modern popular culture promotes celebrity: people who are well known for being well known. Stirring up controversy or scandal and then talking or writing about it enhances celebrity status. Yet, the cult of celebrity does not and cannot adequately explain the hold that a tiny nun from Albania had, and retains, on the conscience of the world.<p></p><p></p>For a woman who neither sought nor expected recognition, Mother Teresa has exercised an enormous influence around the world. Her mis-sionary work on behalf of the poorest of the poor in India was larger than life, giving rise to questions about how her own experiences prepared her to carry it out and to accomplish all that she did. By all accounts, Mother Teresa was intelligent but passive and self-effacing. She had been an ade-quate but undistinguished teacher, a commonplace woman, and an ordi-nary nun, prone to knocking over candles during religious services. Yet, Mother Teresa had one attribute that set her apart in a world often for-getful of God: a deep, abiding faith.<p></p><p></p>Yet, even Mother Teresa, it seems, could not escape the cult of celebrity, though she tried always to use it to the advantage of the poor whom she served. Until the last decade of her life, Mother Teresa enjoyed universal acclaim as a living saint. Although she appeared indifferent to the attention, she was aware of it and, for example, allowed the media to publish poignant photographs of her working among the poor and the dying to illustrate their plight. Her interview with British journalist Mal-colm Muggeridge in 1968 exposed her world to the rest of the world. The public reaction to her work was more than she ever imagined. Donations poured in. But for all the publicity the interview with Muggeridge gar-<p></p> 
x i i	I N T R O D U C T I O N<p></p><p></p>nered for her mission, it may also have set her on the slippery slope that is the price of success: Mother Teresa was becoming famous and all that she did, every word that she uttered, was now for public consumption. For good or ill, she was no longer a devout nun laboring in obscurity.<p></p><p></p>In its appetite for a saintly celebrity, the media scrutinized every aspect of Mother Teresa’s life and work. When charges of wrongdoing surfaced, public opinion, the fickle engine that drives the cult of celebrity, turned against Mother Teresa. Some were dismayed; others were angry and dis-appointed. Cynics everywhere rejoiced that another icon had been smashed. Common faults and foibles were magnified in the public persona of Mother Teresa that the media now brought before the court of public opinion. How could a saint also be stubborn, controlling, and unrealistic? Perhaps Mother Teresa had made a devil’s bargain. She had allowed her-self to become well known to publicize her cause, while personally shun-ning the worldly trappings that accompany celebrity. Suddenly, she seemed not only cranky and demanding, but also hypocritical. At the same time, her unswerving belief in the doctrines of the Catholic Church and her traditional view of the subordinate role of women within it made her a target of liberal doctrinaires. Nevertheless, with all the twists and turns that celebrity brings, Mother Teresa was unswerving in her belief that she was an instrument of God.<p></p><p></p>So, for all her apparent simplicity, and with all that has been said and written about her, it is still easy to misunderstand Mother Teresa. People in the United States and Europe mistook her for a social reformer, deter-mined to rid the world of poverty and injustice. They were disappointed to find out that she was not intent to bring about social change. She doubtless wanted to help and comfort the poor. More important, Mother Teresa sought to bear witness, to show that even on the wretched streets of Calcutta under the worst imaginable conditions, one could encounter God’s grace and love.<p></p><p></p>In 2003, Pope John Paul II beatified Mother Teresa, the final stage on her journey to sainthood. For many who admired her, canonization was a mere formality; Mother Teresa was already a saint. But her beatification has not silenced critics. Many have, in fact, become more strident, hoping to delay or halt her canonization. There is thus considerable justification for additional study of her life and her work. This biography, then, is not only an examination of Mother Teresa’s life, but of the beliefs that shaped it. The two are so closely intertwined that not to examine them together is to risk missing some essential aspect of this ordinary extraordinary woman.<p></p>

<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Chapter  1<p></p><p></p>SKOPJE<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Located in Macedonia, in a region that was formerly part of Albania, the city of Skopje was a bustling commercial center at the beginning of the twentieth century. The city, which straddles the Vardar River, rises ap-proximately 800 feet above sea level. The summers are long and dry, the winters damp, cold, and foggy. Not large by contemporary standards, Skopje had a population of 25,000 at the turn of the century.<p></p><p></p>Founded during the third century B.C. by the Dardanians, early descen-dants of modern-day Albanians from Illyna in the western Balkan Penin-sula and Thracians who lived north of ancient Greece, Skopje, then known as Skupi, later came under the control of the Romanians. By the sixth century, the area fell under the domination of a Slavic people known as the Beregheziti. It was they who gave the city its current name.<p></p><p></p>By the ninth century, owing in part to the weakness of the Byzantine Empire, with its capital in Constantinople (now Istanbul in modern Turkey), Albania came under the dominion of a succession of foreign powers including the Bulgarians, Norman crusaders from France, the Angevins of southern Italy, the Venetians, and the Serbs. The Serbian oc-cupation that began in 1347 was especially hard, prompting huge num-bers of Albanians to migrate to Greece and the Aegean islands.<p></p><p></p>A few decades later the Albanians confronted a new threat. The Turks expanded their empire, known as the Ottoman Empire, to include the Balkan Peninsula. Invading Albania in 1388, the Ottoman Turks, by the middle of the fifteenth century, had succeeded in occupying the entire kingdom. The Turks may have occupied the land, but they had less suc-cess governing the Albanian people. In 1443, Gjergj Kastrioti, also<p></p> 
2	MOTHER TERESA<p></p><p></p>known as Skenderbeg, rallied the Albanian princes and drove the Turks out. For the next 25 years, operating out of a mountain stronghold, Sken-derbeg frustrated every Turkish attempt to regain Albanian territory. His brave fight against one of the mightiest powers of the time won esteem throughout the Western world, as well as securing military and financial support from the Kingdom of Naples, the papacy, Venice, and Ragusa (a province in Sicily located on the southwest side). With Skenderbeg’s death in 1468, however, Albanian resistance gradually eroded, allowing the Turks to reoccupy the kingdom by 1506, again incorporating it into the Ottoman Empire. Even after his death, however, Skenderbeg’s legacy of resistance strengthened Albanian solidarity, kept alive a sense of na-tional identity, and served as a source of inspiration in the ongoing strug-gle for national unity and independence.<p></p><p></p>A FORGOTTEN PEOPLE<p></p><p></p>The Turks established their dominion over Albania just as the Renais-sance was beginning in Italy. Turkish domination of the Balkans cut the region off from contact and exchanges with Western Europe. As a conse-quence, Albania had no chance to participate in, or benefit from, the em-phasis on human capabilities and accomplishments that characterized the Renaissance. Not only did the Balkans miss out on the Renaissance, but the Turks’ conquest of Albania also caused great suffering and vast de-struction of the economy and commerce as well as traditional art and cul-ture. To escape persecution, about one-fourth of the Albanian population fled to southern Italy, Sicily, and the northern part of the Dalmatian coast. Countless others who remained converted to Islam, the religion of the Ottoman Empire.<p></p><p></p>Although the Turks ruled Albania for more than four hundred years, they failed to extend their authority throughout the kingdom. In the highland regions, the Turks exercised only a formal sovereignty. Beyond the reach of the government and the military, the Albanian highlanders refused to pay taxes, to serve in the army, or to surrender their weapons. They did, however, attempt to appease the Turks by offering an annual tribute to Constantinople. Even those Albanians who did fall under Turk-ish sway proved difficult to manage. They rose in rebellion time and again against their conquerors.<p></p><p></p>To quell Albanian resistance, which was motivated as much by the de-fense of Christianity as by the desire for independence, the Turks initiated a systematic effort to convert Albanians to Islam. By the end of the sev-enteenth century, approximately two-thirds of Albanians had embraced<p></p> 
SKOPJE	3
<p></p>Islam. Like their counterparts who had earlier converted, these men and women became Muslims not primarily from religious conviction but to es-cape the exploitation and violence directed toward Christians. Those who refused to convert, for example, endured a crushing tax burden from which Muslims were exempt. The so-called process of Islamization aggra-vated the religious fragmentation of Albanian society, which had began during the Middle Ages. The residue of this religious division persisted into the nineteenth century when leaders of the Albanian national move-ment used the rallying cry “the religion of Albanians is Albanianism” to overcome religious division and foster a sense of national unity.<p></p><p></p>By the middle of the nineteenth century the Ottoman Empire was weakening. Turkey, known as “The Sick Man of Europe,” was having trouble maintaining its hold on its many possessions. Sensing an opportu-nity to break free of Ottoman domination, the Albanians, along with other Balkan peoples, sought to attain their independence. In 1878, the leaders of the Albanian independence movement met in Prizren, a town in Kosovo, to found the Albanian League of Prizren. The league had two main goals. First, to unify Albanian territory, which the Turks had split into four provinces: Kosovo, Shkodra, Monastir, and Janina. Initially, the League of Prizren advocated not Albanian independence, but the cre-ation of an autonomous Albanian state within the Ottoman Empire. Sec-ond, the league initiated a movement to promote Albanian cultural nationalism, emphasizing a distinctly Albanian language, literature, art, and education. Although the Turks suppressed the League of Prizren in 1881, the nationalist spirit of the league lived on. Inspired by the league, Albanian leaders met in the town of Monastir in 1908 to adopt a national alphabet. Based mostly on Latin, this alphabet supplanted several others, including Arabic and Greek, then in use. It is impossible to overestimate the value of an Albanian national language to the drive for national iden-tity and independence.<p></p><p></p>In addition to repression, however, Turkish leaders promised to reform their administration of Albania to give the Albanians greater power to determine local affairs. When in 1908, however (the same year in which the Albanians adopted a national alphabet), a group called the Young Turks, bent on modernizing and strengthening the empire, seized control of the Turkish government, they ignored previous commitments to the Albanians. Frustrated at this turn of events, Albanians took up arms and in 1912 forced the Turks, in effect, to grant Albania near independence. Alarmed at the prospect of an independent Albania, Albania’s Balkan neighbors, who had already made plans to partition the region, declared war on Turkey in October 1912. To prevent the annihilation of the coun-<p></p> 
4	MOTHER TERESA<p></p><p></p>try, Albanian delegates met in Vlorë and, on November 28, 1912, issued the Vlorë Proclamation in which they formally declared Albanian inde-pendence. In the midst of these ethnic, national, and religious conflicts, a child was born in Skopje who would one day try to overcome these differ-ences in order, as she said, to do God’s work on earth.<p></p><p></p>THE FAMILY<p></p><p></p>One of the most ardent nationalists in Skopje was the independent building contractor and wholesale importer of food named Nikola Bojax-hiu. The son of a large and prosperous family that had long engaged in various commercial enterprises, Bojaxhiu moved from Prizren to Skopje because of its growing reputation as a trading center. An ambitious man, Bojaxhiu quickly bought a house in Skopje and in a short time acquired a number of additional properties. Among his first ventures was supplying medicine to one of the leading doctors in town. He later went into part-nership with an Italian businessman who traded in a wide variety of goods including oil, sugar, cloth, and leather.<p></p><p></p>By all accounts, Bojaxhiu was a more-than-capable businessman; he was fluent in five languages and had traveled extensively throughout Eu-rope, the Near East, and North Africa. In addition, he was heavily in-volved in local politics, serving on the town council, and his contracting firm helped to build the first movie theater in Skopje. A patron of the arts, Bojaxhiu was also a faithful member of the local Roman Catholic Church.<p></p><p></p>In time, Bojaxhiu took a wife, marrying Dranafile Bernai in Prizren, the city in which the Albanian League was created and where Bojaxhiu had once lived. The couple soon returned to Skopje, settling into a spacious house with a large garden. Before long, Dranafile gave birth to three chil-dren: a daughter, Aga, was born in 1904; a son, Lazar, followed in 1907. On August 26, 1910, the couple welcomed their second daughter and last child, Agnes Gonxha. A day later, on August 27, Gonxha, which means “flower bud” in Albanian, was baptized at the local Catholic Church.<p></p><p></p>As an adult, Gonxha spoke little of her childhood, saying only that it had been pleasant. What information there is about her early life comes from her brother, Lazar, who, in describing their childhood together, also remembered it as carefree and peaceful. Although a strict discipli-narian, Nikola also took special delight in his children. Rarely did a day pass when they did not eagerly await his return home, and he often brought them trinkets as a token of his fatherly affection. Bojaxhiu also entertained his children, for he had a talent for storytelling, and re-counted for them the sights he had seen and the people he had met on<p></p> 
SKOPJE	5
<p></p>his travels. Then, too, the Bojaxhiu household was often crowded with the visitors who regularly stopped by to talk business or politics with Nikola.<p></p><p></p>Drana Bojaxhiu, or Nana Loke (“Mother Soul”), as the children called her, was a traditional Albanian housewife who looked after her husband and children. During the day, she cooked, cleaned, and mended clothing. As soon as Nikola returned home, though, all work stopped. Drana put on a clean dress, combed her hair, and made sure the children were present-able to greet their father.<p></p><p></p>Like her husband, Drana was a stern taskmaster and had little patience with foolish behavior. One of the few stories that Gonxha told about her early life illustrated her mother’s attitude toward what she considered fri-volity. One evening as the children were chattering, their conversation grew sillier. Drana listened but said nothing. At last she left the room and turned off the main electric switch, plunging the house into darkness. Gonxha concluded: “She told us that there was no use wasting electricity so that such foolishness could go on.”1 Drana passed this trait on to her youngest daughter; as an adult, Mother Teresa objected to wasted time and wasted words.<p></p><p></p>Agnes Gonxha resembled her mother in other ways. A bit plump like Drana, Agnes also had her mother’s oval face and distinctive nose; she was unmistakably her mother’s daughter. Her brother recalled that Gonxha was also generous and helpful, even though her behavior some-times got her into trouble. Gonxha, for instance, helped Lazar to scale the cupboard and steal their mother’s jam or desserts. Needless to say, Drana did not approve.<p></p><p></p>FAITH AND FATHERLAND—FE Y ATDHE<p></p><p></p>All the Bojaxhiu children learned early the idea “Faith and Father-land,” or “Fe Y Atdhe.” This ideal became deeply embedded in their thinking, and remained strong throughout their childhood. The strong nationalist pride of the Albanian people, personified in their father, Nikola Bojaxhiu, became a constant in their lives. Lazar remembered his father telling him and his sisters never to forget whose children they were and from what background they came. Besides opening his home to polit-ical discussion, Nikola also provided financial assistance to the cause of Albanian independence. November 28, 1912, when Gonxha was only two years old, marked a joyous day in the Bojaxhiu household. On that day the Albanians declared their independence, and Nikola and other pa-triots played and danced well into the night.<p></p> 
6	MOTHER TERESA<p></p><p></p>Nikola may have passed on to his children a sense of ethnic identity and nationalist pride; however, it was Drana who nurtured the children’s spiritual growth. Almost every evening, the Bojaxhiu family gathered in the living room to recite the rosary. Drana also oversaw the children’s evening prayers. A devout Catholic who went to Mass almost every day, Drana not only made sure her children practiced their religion but also in-corporated it into their everyday lives. This was easier said than done. The Roman Catholic community in Albania was small; fewer than 10 percent of the population declared themselves Roman Catholic. Al-though few in number, the Roman Catholic community in Skopje and throughout Albania was close-knit.<p></p><p></p>Not only did Drana practice religious devotion, she also believed deeply in the spiritual value of good works. She was always available to help those in need. In this practice, her husband supported her and Gonxha aided her. On any given day, Nikola left with Drana enough money to help the poor children or adults who came to the house. Com-monly, the less fortunate not only received a hand out from the Bojaxhiu family, but also took meals with them, reminding the children that the needy were also part of their larger human family. “Some of them are our relations,” Drana once told her children, “but all of them are our people.”2 One of the strongest of Lazar’s memories is of his mother taking in a woman stricken with a tumor and nursing her back to health. Besides tak-ing strangers into her home, Drana visited the poor in theirs, taking them food, money, and medicine. On these occasions, Gonxha often accompa-nied her mother, helping her as she made her way from family to family of-fering both spiritual and material comfort. Drana’s Christian charity offered a powerful example, helping to mold Gonxha’s spiritual life and to shape her destiny.<p></p><p></p>When the time came for the children to begin school, they attended classes held in Sacred Heart Church. For four years, the Bojaxhiu children studied in the Albanian language. At the fifth year, they began to learn in Serbo-Croatian. Upon leaving the church school, the children went to public schools where all the instruction was given in Serbo-Croatian. Early on, Gonxha distinguished herself as a gifted and disciplined student.<p></p><p></p>TRAGEDY<p></p><p></p>Nikola’s participation in Albanian politics continued even after inde-pendence. When, in 1919, Albanian leaders tried to acquire Kosovo, Nikola traveled to a political gathering in Belgrade, Yugoslavia. While at-tending a banquet, Nikola fell seriously ill. Alarmed at her husband’s con-<p></p> 
SKOPJE	7
<p></p>dition, Drana sent Gonxha to find the parish priest. He was not at home. Growing more desperate and not knowing what to do, Gonxha went to the Skopje railway station hoping to find a priest. Luck was with her. She did locate a priest who agreed to see her father. The situation was grave. Nikola was dying. The priest arrived at his bedside in time to administer Extreme Unction, today known as the Sacrament of the Sick, which Catholics receive when they are expected to die. Just as the priest finished performing the rite, Nikola began to hemorrhage (bleed internally) and was rushed to the hospital. Emergency surgery failed to save him. Gonxha’s robust and outgoing father was dead at the age of 45. The doc-tors and family were convinced that his political enemies had poisoned him, though no conclusive evidence ever emerged to prove the allega-tion.<p></p><p></p>Overnight, life in the Bojaxhiu household changed. Following Nikola’s death, his partner took over the business and left nothing for the family. In addition, even though Drana had the right to estates that her family owned, she had no documents to prove her claim, nor did she have the time, inclination, energy, or money to pursue the matter through the courts. Only the family home remained.<p></p><p></p>Nikola’s death devastated his wife; Drana fell into deep, prolonged, and often incapacitating grief. Responsibility for the younger children fell in-creasingly on the shoulders of the oldest, Aga. After several months, Drana began to emerge from her mourning. At least the family had a place to live, though Drana wondered how, with her husband’s resources gone, she could provide for her children.<p></p><p></p>“HOME IS WHERE THE MOTHER IS”<p></p><p></p>Fortunately, Drana Bojaxhiu was possessed of an entrepreneurial spirit and soon set about rebuilding her life and supporting her children. She handcrafted embroidery and was soon not only selling her handiwork, but marketing the various types of cloth and carpets for which Skopje was fa-mous. Lazar remembered accompanying his mother to the textile factories where Drana met with the managers who sought her advice on designs and materials to boost sales.<p></p><p></p>As the family’s financial status improved, the Bojaxhiu household once more became a place where the poor could come for a meal and some-times a bed. As soon as she could, Drana again began to set aside money to help those in need and, despite her busy schedule, still found time to visit the poor. At least once a week she called on an elderly woman whose own family had abandoned her. File, a poor alcoholic woman, also bene-<p></p> 
8	MOTHER TERESA<p></p><p></p>fited from Drana’s care and largess. Six orphan children came to live in the house. Drana continued to impress upon her children the importance of helping the less fortunate. When you do good, she told the children, do it quietly, without calling attention to your own virtue.<p></p><p></p>Drana always found creative ways in which to instruct her children. Summoning them one day, she asked them to inspect a basket in which a number of good apples rested. She then placed a rotten apple in the bas-ket and covered it. The following day, she had the children inspect the apples. They discovered that many of the apples, so luscious the day be-fore, were now beginning to rot. The moral was simple but profound: it takes only one corrupt person to corrupt many others. She then reminded her children to stay clear of bad company lest they suffer the same fate as the good apples in the basket. Drana’s influence on her children was ex-traordinary, especially after their father’s death. Despite her need to work and manage a business, and despite her devotion to the poor, Drana still spent time with her children, who benefited immeasurably from her guid-ance. So powerful was Drana’s presence that Gonxha recalled “Home is where the mother is.”3<p></p><p></p>FINDING THE PATH<p></p><p></p>As the children grew older, Drana insisted that they become more in-volved in the activities of their local parish church. Besides her mother, the Sacred Heart church exercised the most influence on young Gonxha. The church was not only important for its religious teaching, but, as a center of Albanian culture and identity, also reinforced the nationalism of the Bojaxhiu family.<p></p><p></p>Of the three children, Gonxha most readily became involved with the church. She early showed a tendency for religious devotion. When she learned to play the mandolin, it was the church to which she offered her talent. Along with her sister, Aga, Gonxha joined the choir; together the girls earned a reputation for their clear voices and frequently sang solos.<p></p><p></p>“I was only twelve years old . . . when I first felt the desire to become a nun,” Mother Teresa recalled.4 Much beyond that information, she re-vealed little about the circumstances that prompted her vocation. Throughout her life, Mother Teresa maintained that her religious experi-ence was private. She would not discuss it. What made her calling ex-traordinary was that at age 12 Gonxha had never seen a nun. Yet, her desire to pursue a religious life did not come as a surprise to her mother. Of her three children, Gonxha suffered from the poorest health with a chronic cough and weak chest. Drana believed that if her youngest was<p></p> 
SKOPJE	9
<p></p>not the first to die, she would be called to God in another way. Although at 12 Gonxha believed she had received her life’s calling, she did nothing more about it. For the next six years, she continued her schooling and par-ticipated in church activities. There was, for the moment, no more talk about becoming a nun.<p></p><p></p>FATHER JAMBREKOVIC<p></p><p></p>Father Franjo Jambrekovic, a young Jesuit priest of Croatian descent, arrived at the Sacred Heart parish in 1925. He was destined to exert a great influence on Gonxha. Among the many innovations that Father Jambrekovic carried out was the introduction of a parish library in which Gonxha soon passed countless hours reading. Father Jambrekovic also es-tablished the Sodality of Children of Mary, a Catholic organization for young girls that the Jesuits had created. Gonxha joined. Finally, Father Jambrekovic started a Catholic youth group that sponsored walks, parties, concerts, and other outings for the boys and girls of the parish.<p></p><p></p>Most important for Gonxha, Father Jambrekovic passed on to the members of Sacred Heart news of the missionary efforts that the Jesuits had undertaken. In 1924, he explained, a group of Yugoslav Jesuits had gone to Bengal, India. From their outpost, the missionaries wrote impas-sioned letters describing the horrible conditions under which the poor and the infirm lived. Father Jambrekovic read some of these letters to in-terested parishioners. On occasion, a missionary came to Sacred Heart to discuss the Jesuits’ work in India and to solicit donations. Father Jam-brekovic was enthusiastic in his support of these efforts, and spoke often about them. Gonxha assisted by pointing out to the younger children the location of India on a world map. After the arrival of Father Jambrekovic, she also became more active in the prayer groups of the sodality, which of-fered prayers for the success of Catholic missions. She told a cousin who was earning extra money by giving mandolin lessons to send the money to the poor in India.<p></p><p></p>The zeal with which Father Jambrekovic spoke of the Jesuit missions in India sparked a renewed sense of devotion in Gonxha. She was already immersed in church activities, singing in the choir, helping to organize parish festivals, and teaching the younger children their catechism. Her love of teaching and her deep religious fervor prompted her to consider the possibility of doing missionary work. As a young girl, she had dreamed of working with the poor of Africa. The more she heard about the mis-sions in India, however, the more she was drawn to the possibility of work-ing there.<p></p> 
10	MOTHER TERESA<p></p><p></p>By the late 1920s, Gonxha had grown into an attractive young woman, mature beyond her years. A good student, neat and clean in appearance, self-disciplined, and well organized, she had already earned a reputation in the community for her friendliness and willingness to help anyone. Like her mother, she cared for anyone in need.<p></p><p></p>But Gonxha was struggling with her decision to become a nun. A gifted writer and poet, she often carried a small notebook with her in which to record her poetry and reflections. She continued to play music with her friends and, at times, entertained thoughts of becoming a writer or a mu-sician. Many of her friends regretted that she did not pursue these careers, for her talent was unquestioned.<p></p><p></p>Trying to decide what do to with her life, Gonxha turned to Father Jambrekovic for advice. During their discussions, she asked how one knew whether the calling to serve God was genuine. Father Jambrekovic ex-plained that if one was truly called, that person would feel such deep joy at the decision that there could be little doubt. In later years, Mother Teresa acknowledged that there was no doubt in her mind about her deci-sion, stating simply that God had made the choice for her.<p></p><p></p>By 1928, when she was 18, Gonxha was spending more time at the shrine of the Madonna of Letnice, located a short distance from Skopje on the slopes of Black Mountain. There she prayed for guidance. The place had a special meaning to Gonxha. Among the highlights of the parish year was the annual pilgrimage to the chapel of the Madonna. When Nikola was alive, the family often made the journey in a horse-drawn carriage, joining many others on their pilgrimage. After her hus-band died, Drana made the journey twice a year: once with a group and once alone and on foot. Gonxha had always looked forward to this trip, but because of her health, Drana sometimes kept her at home. It was at the Shrine of the Madonna that Gonxha sought affirmation of her deci-sion to become a nun.<p></p><p></p>One day, after returning home from a visit to the shrine, Gonxha in-formed her mother that she had made up her mind to become a nun. Be-cause of her interest in missionary work, she intended to apply to the order of the Loreto Sisters, an Irish branch of the Institute of the Blessed Virgin Mary who worked with the Jesuits in Bengal. Drana shut herself in her room. When she came out the next day, she gave her daughter her blessing, but also warned her that in choosing to become a nun, she must turn her life over to God without doubt, without fear, without hesitation, and without remorse.<p></p><p></p>By this time, Gonxha’s brother, Lazar, had been away from home for several years, attending school in Austria and then later joining the newly<p></p> 
SKOPJE	11
<p></p>formed Albanian army as a Second Lieutenant. When Lazar received the news of his younger sister’s decision to become a nun, he wrote to her ask-ing whether she was sure about her decision. Gonxha replied, “You think you are important because you are an officer serving a king with two mil-lion subjects. But I am serving the King of the whole world.”5<p></p><p></p>All too soon, the time came for Gonxha to leave. She was to travel first to Paris, where the Mother Superior of the Loreto Sisters was to interview her to determine whether Gonxha was acceptable to the order. On Au-gust 15, 1928, the Feast of the Assumption, Gonxha traveled for the last time to the shrine of the Madonna of Letnice. Later, she attended a con-cert by the Sodality group, which was given partly to honor her, and had her photograph taken. That evening, guests came to the Bojaxhiu home to wish her farewell. Many of her friends and family brought gifts; one of those she most treasured was a gold fountain pen that a cousin gave to her.<p></p><p></p>The next day, Gonxha went to the Skopje railway station. Her mother and sister traveled with her as far as Zagreb; friends gathered to wish the Bojaxhiu women a safe journey. Gonxha cried and waved her handker-chief from the train window in farewell. The threesome made the most of their time in Zagreb. Finally, on October 8, Gonxha, accompanied by an-other young woman, Betika Kanjc, who also hoped to join the Loreto Sis-ters, boarded the train to Paris. As Gonxha made her way to the train, her mother and sister returned to Skopje. Waving goodbye, Gonxha bid farewell to her mother, whom she never saw again.<p></p><p></p>NOTES<p></p><p></p>Eileen Egan, Such a Vision of the Street: Mother Teresa—The Spirit and the Work (New York: Image Books, 1986), p. 9.<p></p><p></p>Kathryn Spink, Mother Teresa (San Francisco: Harper & Row, 1997), pp. 6–7.<p></p><p></p>Spink, Mother Teresa, p. 6.<p></p><p></p>Navin Chawla, Mother Teresa: The Authorized Biography (Rockport, Mass.: Element, 1992), p. 3.<p></p><p></p>Spink, Mother Teresa, p. 11.<p></p>

<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Chapter  2<p></p><p></p>ANSWERING THE CALL<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>As the train pulled away from the Zagreb station on its way to Paris, Gonxha must have thought about the consequences of her decision. Not only was she leaving family and friends, she was also leaving the only home she had ever known. If the Loreto Sisters accepted her application it would mean lifetime separation from her family and her country. She could prob-ably never even visit her homeland again. The chances of her family visit-ing her were equally remote; travel was expensive and there would be little opportunity for her mother, brother, or sister to come to India. Whether she felt sad and lonely as the train rolled on toward Paris, Gonxha knew that she had made the right choice. Her life belonged to God.<p></p><p></p>THE INSTITUTE OF THE BLESSED VIRGIN MARY<p></p><p></p>The order that Gonxha hoped to join has a long and difficult history. In 1609, an English woman named Mary Ward established the Institute of the Blessed Virgin Mary (IBVM), with which the Loreto Sisters are affili-ated. Ward believed passionately in the equality of women, and deter-mined that they should be educated accordingly. In creating the IBVM, Ward envisioned women living and acting in the world. She did not want members of the Institute to live cloistered lives, as was the tradition for Catholic women’s religious orders. Rather, inspired by the Gospels, women would carry the love of Christ to those most in need of it: the poor, the downtrodden, and the helpless. Ward also saw this woman-centered order as being relatively free from the governance of male hier-archy that dominated the church.<p></p> 
14	MOTHER TERESA<p></p><p></p>Ward took as her model the Society of Jesus, the Jesuits. Founded in 1539 by Ignatius Loyola, a former soldier turned priest, the Jesuits were not only missionaries but teachers. Loyola believed that by offering reli-gious and moral instruction, by making devotional life accessible to the young, and by preaching a message of service to others, the Jesuits offered the greatest service to God and His holy church.<p></p><p></p>Ward’s interest in Catholic education arose in part because of the con-tinuing religious persecution of Catholics in England after King Henry VIII broke with the church in 1534; as a result, English Catholics often fled and sought their religious education on the continent. Ward and her associates established their first school at St. Omer, France. While there, Ward and her group became known to the locals as the English Ladies, a description still applied throughout much of Western Europe. Despite fac-ing continuous financial difficulty, Ward in time established houses and schools in Bavaria (Germany), Austria, and Italy. To communicate with these different convents, Ward traveled between countries mostly on foot.<p></p><p></p>Although successful, Ward’s vision came at a price. Her ideas about women’s role in religious life were so novel, especially in the Catholic world, that in 1631, church authorities suppressed the Institute. Charged with heresy, Mary was herself imprisoned by the Inquisition and briefly excommunicated, or banned, from the Roman Catholic Church. Only through the intervention of Pope Urban VIII was she eventually freed and reinstated to full church membership, her organization now operating under papal protection.<p></p><p></p>In 1639, Ward returned to England where the climate toward Catho-lics had improved during the reign of King Charles I, who had married a Catholic princess and was himself sympathetic to Catholicism. Ward re-mained in England until she died in Yorkshire in 1645. Upon her death, the Institute was in shambles. Embroiled in a civil war against his politi-cal and religious enemies—a war he was destined to lose, and with it his kingdom and his head—Charles could offer the order scant protection. Radical English Protestants, known as the Puritans, who prevailed in the civil war against Charles, disbanded Ward’s houses and schools in En-gland. In 1650, the year after Puritan leaders had executed Charles, the Sisters of the Blessed Virgin Mary again fled England, seeking refuge in Catholic France. Not until 1677 did they return to Yorkshire under the protection of Charles II, the son of Charles I who had been restored to the throne in 1660. Like his father, Charles II was sympathetic to Catholi-cism. It was only through the perseverance of Ward’s followers, and the protection that both the Vatican and the English crown extended, that the IBVM survived to continue the work that she had inspired.<p></p>

<p></p>THE LORETO SISTERS<p></p><p></p>Recognizing the need for Catholic education in their homeland, Irish church officials invited the IBVM sisters to establish a school in Dublin. However, the Institute was not in a position to send Sisters immediately, but arranged that a young local woman, Frances Ball, would join the or-ganization and recruit other Irish women. In 1814, Ball traveled to York, returning to Dublin in 1821. Now known as Mother Teresa, Ball settled at Rathfarnham House with two companions. Because the three women lived together in Rathfarnham House, Mother Teresa decided to call their order “Loreto” after the Italian village to which the home of the Holy Family (Jesus, Mary, and Joseph) was supposed to have been miraculously transported. The name stuck, and eventually the order became known as “Loreto Sisters,” although the official title remains the Institute of the Blessed Virgin Mary.<p></p><p></p>Early in 1841, a German missionary asked Mother Teresa to send members of her order to India. By then, generations of Irish, having en-listed in the British Army, were stationed in India, which was part of the British Empire. Many had married and started families. If, however, one or another of the parents died or if they deserted their family, scores of Irish children were lost to the Catholic Church. Beginning in 1834, the Jesuits began arriving in Bengal near Calcutta to deal with this problem. They established St. Xavier’s School in which they taught Catholics, Hindus, and Muslims alike. It soon became apparent, though, that the community needed a separate school for the daughters of Irish Catholic military families.<p></p><p></p>When first approached about the possibility of sending nuns to India to staff the girls school, Mother Teresa gently but firmly refused. There were too many children in Ireland in need of assistance. There was also a short-age of nuns. Her German visitor countered that in refusing to send mem-bers of her order to India, Mother Teresa was, in effect, refusing to provide a Christian education for those children. Mother Teresa relented. The priest could make his case before the entire community; they would de-cide whether to accept the mission to India.<p></p><p></p>In the end, seven sisters decided to go to India, marking the beginning of Loreto missionary work there. On August 23, 1841, the seven, accom-panied by two priests and six postulants, or novice nuns, set sail. Almost four months later, they disembarked in Calcutta. The little band took pos-session of the house at 5 Middleton Row, where they were to live and teach. The sisters prepared the once lavishly furnished house into simpler living quarters and classrooms. The 67-foot dining room became the school hall.<p></p> 
16	MOTHER TERESA<p></p><p></p>The sisters then traveled to the local orphanage near the cathedral of Our Lady of the Rosary to meet with church officials and the children. Fi-nally, on January 10, 1842, the Loreto School opened its doors to board-ers and day students. As became the custom with the Loreto Sisters, students whose families could afford to do so paid tuition. Their monies, combined with other donations, enabled the sisters to provide a free edu-cation for children of the poor and to operate an orphanage and a widow’s asylum.<p></p><p></p>The initial reports that Mother Teresa received from India were enthu-siastic. Streams of volunteers now offered to go to India to aid the Loreto Sisters of Calcutta. Even when a number of the nuns died of cholera, the flow of volunteers did not stop. It was this pioneering and courageous group of teachers that Gonxha Bojaxhiu soon hoped to join.<p></p><p></p>RATHFARNHAM HOUSE<p></p><p></p>Upon their arrival in Paris, the two girls were taken to the Villa Moli-tor to see Mother Eugene MacAvin, the sister in charge of the Loreto House in Paris. There they were interviewed with the help of an inter-preter from the Yugoslavian embassy. Both Gonxha and Betike were ap-proved and then sent on to Dublin where they would stay at the Loreto Abbey at Rathfarnham House.<p></p><p></p>The two arrived at Rathfarnham, a simple red-brick building, in Sep-tember; Gonxha was somewhat comforted upon seeing the statue of the Blessed Mother in the courtyard. The two young women, wearing the long white habit, or dress, and black veil of the Loreto nuns, spent most of the next six weeks studying English, the language in which they were to teach. In order to help them become more comfortable with the language, the two were instructed never to speak in their native tongue, something that both Betike and Gonxha obediently followed. Unlike the native-speaking novitiates, Gonxha and Betike received little other instruction and had little opportunity to get to know many of the other sisters and postulates staying at Loreto Abbey. From all accounts, though, it appeared that Gonxha had inherited her father’s flair for languages and was further helped in her studies by Mother Mary Emmanuel McDermott who was another postulant at Loreto Abbey. At the end of six weeks, on December 1, 1928, the two women set sail for India and their new life. Upon their arrival there, the two would begin their novitiate, that is the period of study and prayer which every nun takes before her final vows.<p></p><p></p>The sea voyage proved long and arduous, winding its way through the Suez Canal, then the Red Sea, the Indian Ocean, and finally the Bay of<p></p> 
ANSWERING THE CALL	17
<p></p>Bengal. Christmas was celebrated aboard the ship with three other Fran-ciscan nuns, also missionaries bound for India. The group sang Christmas carols around a small paper crib made quickly for the celebration. Their only regret was that there was no priest aboard to celebrate mass. But that all changed when the ship made port at Colombo, where a priest would accompany the nuns for the rest of the voyage.<p></p><p></p>On January 6, 1929, the ship made port at Calcutta. But at this point, Gonxha had little chance to become acquainted with her surroundings. After just a few days, on January 16, she was sent to the Loreto Novitiate located in Darjeeling, a fashionable hill resort about 400 miles north of Calcutta.<p></p><p></p>LIFE IN THE LORETO CONVENT<p></p><p></p>Life at the Loreto Convent for Gonxha Bojaxhiu was disciplined and rigorous. Entering a Catholic convent during the early twentieth century was like being plunged into another world, one that was isolated and rel-atively contained. For the next two years, dressed in the black habit and veil of the order, Gonxha kept up with her English studies as well as learn-ing the Bengali language. Under the watchful eye of the novice mistress, who oversaw the novitiates’ training, the young women went weekly to confession. Dinnertime was spent listing to one of the sisters reading about the lives of the saints, or from the rules of Loreto. Every day from 9 to 11, Gonxha and the other novitiates taught at St. Teresa’s School, a one-room schoolhouse affiliated with the convent. Here 20 small boys and girls met to receive instruction. She quickly earned a reputation for being hard working, cheerful, and charitable in her dealings with others.<p></p><p></p>On March 24, 1931, Gonxha Bojaxhiu took her first vows—a lifetime promised to chastity, poverty, and obedience to God as a sister of Loreto. As was the custom, Gonxha had chosen a new name for herself to sym-bolize her new life with God. Her choice was an inspired one based on the late-nineteenth-century French nun Thérèse Martin who received her call to serve Christ at a young age and was especially interested in mis-sionary work. She entered the Carmelite order at the age of 15, and throughout her life, Thérèse dedicated her prayers and service toward mis-sionaries and their success. She hoped one day to become a missionary herself to serve with the Carmelite convent in Hanoi, Indochina (now Vietnam). Unfortunately, her dream was never realized, as she was struck down by tuberculosis at the age of 24.<p></p><p></p>Throughout her short life, Thérèse Martin strove to honor God in what she called her “little way,” that is a life given to the Lord in complete<p></p> 
18	MOTHER TERESA<p></p><p></p>trust and self-surrender, much like a child with a loving parent. In 1927, Pope Pius XI canonized Thérèse Martin who now became St. Thérèse of the Child Jesus, and the patron saint of missions. In light of Gonxha’s own life, her choice came as no surprise.<p></p><p></p>Unfortunately, there was a problem with her choice. There was al-ready one nun in the convent with the name Marie-Thérèse. Not want-ing to change her chosen name, Gonxha merely decided to go by the Spanish spelling “Teresa.” Still the name change caused some confusion throughout her life, as she was thought to have taken the name of the great Spanish saint, Teresa of Avila. Whenever asked, however, she al-ways patiently explained her choice. For the sisters in the Loreto Con-vent, however, the new Teresa soon had a nickname that further distinguished her: Bengali Teresa, an acknowledgment of her ability to speak the language so well.<p></p><p></p>BENGALI TERESA<p></p><p></p>Not long after taking her vows, Gonxha Bojaxhiu, now called Sister Teresa, took the train from Darjeeling to Calcutta. There, she was to begin teaching at St. Mary’s School, located in the eastern district of Calcutta. It was to be her place of residence and work for the next 17 years.<p></p><p></p>During the 1920s, the contrast between the cities of Darjeeling and Calcutta was startling. In Darjeeling, one breathed clear mountain air, and a walk in a flower-filled meadow was not far away. It was a city of re-fined culture, of modern European architecture and imported luxury, a re-treat for those unaccustomed to the heat and humidity of India. Calcutta, while a dynamic and cosmopolitan city, serving as the political capital of British India, was another story. The city teemed with humanity, over-crowded and spilling into the streets and alleys throughout. It was on one hand a city enriched by the culture and arts of India; on the other, it was a cesspool of human misery and degradation.<p></p><p></p>Upon her arrival, Sister Teresa was taken to the eastern district of the city where the school and living quarters for the Loreto nuns was located. Here the Loreto Sisters worked with the Daughters of Saint Anne, a local congregation of nuns founded by the Loreto Sisters in 1898. These nuns, who were Bengali women, wore not the long black habit and veil of the European order, but the traditional sari, the dress worn by Indian women. For the hot summers, the sari worn was white; blue was used for the cooler autumn and winter months.<p></p>

<p></p>ST. MARY’S SCHOOL<p></p><p></p>The school was hidden from the everyday world by high gray walls and tall iron gates. Upon passing through the entrance gates, one came upon a complex of buildings with playing fields and well-tended lawns. The campus comprised several buildings of varying architectural styles. Besides an administrative building and smaller gray classroom building was St. Mary’s School. There were also quarters for the nuns and for those stu-dents who boarded at the school, mostly orphans, girls from broken homes, and children with only one parent.<p></p><p></p>The school had already established a reputation for itself. Established in 1841, as one of the six Loreto schools in Calcutta, the Calcutta school in Entally educated orphans, the sons and daughters of the affluent and foreign families living in the city. All children wore the same uniform; there was no distinction by the sisters of the rich from the poor, the Euro-pean from the Indian, Catholic from non-Catholic. The school was also known for educating “Loreto Girls,” that is young Indian women who graduated from Loreto College and who would go on to positions in edu-cation and social welfare within Calcutta and India. Not only did teach-ers and welfare workers graduate from Loreto College, but in time the first woman judge of the Delhi High Court, a judge of the High Court of Cal-cutta, and several members of the Indian Parliament all received degrees from Loreto. In all, some 500 children and young women were in atten-dance at the Loreto schools at Entally.<p></p><p></p>Here Sister Teresa took her place, teaching alongside the Daughters of St. Anne. She taught history and geography. She also became more com-fortable in her use of the Bengali language as St. Mary’s classes were taught in both English and Bengali. She soon added another language, Hindi. Her classrooms varied: sometimes, she taught in what once had been a chapel and was now broken into five class areas; other times, she taught in what was once the stables, or outside in the courtyard.<p></p><p></p>Though the Loreto Sisters might have been sequestered behind the walls of their school and convent, they were not sheltered from the over-whelming poverty of the area; for the poor conditions of the area were found in the shabby environment of the school itself. Everyday, before be-ginning the day’s lessons, Sister Teresa rolled up the sleeves of her habit, found water and a broom, and proceeded to sweep the floor, much to the delight and amazement of her students, as only people of the very lowest caste performed menial duties such as these. When Teresa saw where the children ate and slept, she was distressed at the terrible condition there.<p></p> 
20	MOTHER TERESA<p></p><p></p>Yet, she also found solace and comfort through the happiness and grati-tude of her young charges. Merely placing a hand on a dirty forehead or holding the hand of a small child brought her great joy. Many of the chil-dren took to calling her “Ma” which meant “Mother,” a term that she treasured.<p></p><p></p>According to one former student, among the tasks Sister Teresa will-ingly took on was the organization of classes for the primary school chil-dren. Sister Teresa also made sure that the children received baths; for many, this was a real treat and something to look forward to. Prizes were awarded at the end of the school year for the students; in many cases, the most coveted were bars of soap.<p></p><p></p>Former students remember Sister Teresa as an engaging teacher. When teaching Sunday School catechism lessons, she often told stories of her own childhood in Skopje. Her geography classes were exciting; many stu-dents believed that she made the world come alive for them in a way not seen or felt before. This is, perhaps, ironic because Sister Teresa had seen little of the world herself and would not leave the area she resided in for over 30 years.<p></p><p></p>By all accounts, Sister Teresa again showed her willingness to work hard. She needed her fortitude; the days at St. Mary’s were long. Each day began at half past five in the morning. Upon awakening, the sisters would pray and read their prescribed lessons in the prayer book, or from the Scriptures or New Testament. All were expected to attend morning mass at six o’clock. Classes were held from 9 A.M. to 3 P.M., with tea held after-ward. Other hours at St. Mary’s were used for looking after the small chil-dren there. There were also other duties awaiting them: papers and lessons to be corrected and a children’s recreation hour to be supervised. Sister Teresa also oversaw the children’s evening meals and bedtime. Self-discipline was essential if one was to accomplish everything in a timely fashion. Failure to do so indicated an inability to stay within the order.<p></p><p></p>Throughout her time at the school, Sister Teresa showed herself to be a pious but not overly demonstrative woman. She was charitable and did not tolerate unkindness from anyone, whether a child or an adult. Taking a firm attitude toward her young charges, Sister Teresa rarely displayed her temper at wrongdoing. In spite of the backbreaking work, she always had a smile and a kind word for people. She was no stranger to humor either: when told a good joke or funny story, Sister Teresa clasped her waist in both hands and would often bend over with laughter.<p></p><p></p>Although the sisters of Loreto took vows to live in poverty, Sister Teresa somehow managed to acquire those things that no one else wanted. Her sheets had more patches and darns than the others. She<p></p> 
ANSWERING THE CALL	21
<p></p>often wore ill-fitting second-hand shoes, which over time would misshape and deform her feet. Yet she never complained, maintaining a humble and steady demeanor. She was, by all appearances, an ordinary nun, carrying out her religious duties. Neither was she particularly intelligent: her edu-cation at best was adequate. Some at the convent remember her more for her inability to light the candles at the Benediction service. As one sister who lived with her during this period recalled, “She was very ordinary. We just looked upon her as one of our Sisters who was very devoted and ded-icated.”1 It was this very ordinariness that made the journey Sister Teresa embarked upon so extraordinary.<p></p><p></p>Sister Teresa also helped with the Sodality of the Blessed Virgin, the same organization that had so heavily influenced her life in Skopje. Work-ing with Father Julien Henry, a Belgian Jesuit priest, Sister Teresa partici-pated in the meetings, prayers, and study club sponsored by the group. In addition, Sister Teresa, working with Father Henry, helped the girls of so-dality aid the poor.<p></p><p></p>On the other side of the convent wall was the slum area (bustee) known as Motijihl, or Pearl Lake, named for a discolored sump-water pond lo-cated in the center of the area. It was from this pond that the residents drew their drinking, cooking, and washing water. Surrounding the pond were the wretched, mud-floor huts of the poor who lived in the neighbor-hood. It was an area desperately in need of comfort. For Father Henry, this was an opportunity to teach the older girls of St. Mary’s about works of service. Every day during the school week, the priest met with the girls whose ages ranged from the early teens to their early twenties.<p></p><p></p>On Saturday, the girls left the walls of their compound and ventured into Motijihl in groups to visit with these families, often bearing small items for the children of the poor. Other groups traveled to the Nilratan Sarkar Hospital to visit the sick, where they comforted family members or wrote letters for those unable to do so. Although Sister Teresa took great stock in the efforts of her students, she could not join them because of the rule of enclosure practiced by the Loreto nuns. But perhaps the most im-portant outcome of these efforts was the indirect link forged between the poor of Calcutta and Sister Teresa.<p></p><p></p>On May 24, 1937, Sister Teresa traveled to Darjeeling to take her final vows. During the ceremony, Teresa solemnly committed herself to the Loreto Sisters and to a lifetime of poverty, chastity, and obedience in ser-vice to the Lord. Upon her return to Calcutta, she once again plunged into her busy days and teaching, much to the delight of several young children who feared that she had gone away for good. Nothing had changed, save Sister Teresa’s name. She was now to be addressed as<p></p> 
22	MOTHER TERESA<p></p><p></p>Mother Teresa, the name she would go by for the rest of her life. At the age of 27, her destiny seemed to be fulfilled. At the same time, India was in the midst of trying to fulfill its own destiny.<p></p><p></p>THE JEWEL IN THE CROWN<p></p><p></p>The India that Mother Teresa came to was no longer the bright and glittering jewel in the British Empire’s crown. By 1929, the British had been in India for a little over three centuries and had governed it exclu-sively for over 70 years. Now in the early years of the twentieth century, a growing unrest among Indian natives for self-government was increasing and British control over its largest colony was waning.<p></p><p></p>The British presence in India is a long and dramatic story. Beginning in the late fifteenth century with the early sea voyages of Portuguese ex-plorer Vasco da Gama, India became a prized possession eagerly sought by many European countries. The Portuguese were the first to claim India, her people, and her natural resources for their own. Over the next two centuries, the Dutch, British, and French challenged the Portuguese for the Indian trade.<p></p><p></p>Of all the European nations to lay claim to India, Britain eventually won and stayed. Beginning in 1600, with the creation of the British East India Company, the British established trading posts in the key cities of Madras, Bombay, and Calcutta. Despite an encroaching French presence, the English held fast. By 1757, the British had established a strong foothold in the country.<p></p><p></p>What began as a trading empire gradually grew into political rule. That the conquest came about as the result of a private trading company en-gaging in conflict chiefly through the use of native Indian soldiers, known as Sepoys, seemed to matter little. By 1849, the rule of the British East India Company was extended over virtually the whole of the subconti-nent by conquest or treaties.<p></p><p></p>Despite the use of natives as soldiers, the British took a rather high-handed approach to their new possession. Missionaries introduced Chris-tianity and English customs, but not all Indians were eager to give up their traditional ways. As a result, a great wave of unrest began building, and exploded in 1857, when a rumor was circulated among the company’s In-dian soldiers that the rifle cartridge-papers they had to tear with their teeth were greased with the fat of cows and pigs. The cow is sacred to Hin-dus, and the pig is abhorred by Muslims. The rumor provoked the great Sepoy Revolt, or Indian Mutiny, of 1857 in which hundreds of British were killed. By the time the mutiny was quelled, the East India Company<p></p> 
ANSWERING THE CALL	23
<p></p>no longer controlled British India, and a year later, the British Crown took over the administration. Almost two decades later, in 1876, Parlia-ment ruled that India should be designated part of the British empire; the following year Queen Victoria was crowned empress of India.<p></p><p></p>THE BRITISH RAJ<p></p><p></p>For the next quarter century following the Indian Mutiny, British rule, or raj, of India was at its peak. Haunted by the horrific memory of the mutiny, the British government enacted a series of measures to avoid an-other conflict from taking place. To oversee the day-to-day administration of the colony’s provinces, a viceroy of India was appointed by the crown. However, Hindu and Muslim princes continued to govern almost 600 na-tive states, which were for the most part autonomous. However, they were forbidden to make war on one another, and to keep an eye on things, the viceroy appointed an agent to each royal state whose job it was to advise the ruler.<p></p><p></p>British rule brought internal peace and economic development to India. The British not only built roads and railways, but canals, irrigation works, mills, and factories. They introduced Western law and police sys-tems, modernized cities, and built schools. Despite these efforts at nation building, many Indians resented the aloof and exacting attitude of the British government. A growing number of Indian intellectuals, many of whom were the products of an English education, began dreaming of a free India. In 1885, the Indian National Congress was created; its estab-lishment marked the beginnings of a growing and organized protest for In-dian independence.<p></p><p></p>TOWARD A FREE INDIA<p></p><p></p>At the outbreak of World War I in 1914, Indian troops were called upon to aid the British and their allies against the Germans. Although In-dians did so, in the wake of the war, nationalist agitation increased. The British Parliament, recognizing that something had to be done to appease the nationalists, passed a reform act in 1919, which provided for the cre-ation of provincial councils that allowed Indians to participate in helping form policy with regard to agriculture, education, and public health. But the provincial councils were not enough for the extreme nationalists, such as those under the leadership of Mohandas K. Gandhi. This group soon gained control of the Indian National Congress. In addition, Gandhi preached resistance to the British by noncooperation, or nonviolent resis-<p></p> 
24	MOTHER TERESA<p></p><p></p>tance in most every aspect of daily life. This meant boycotting all British-made goods, refusing to send children to British schools and colleges, ig-noring British courts of law, and rejecting British titles and honors. Noncompliance extended to British elections and the British tax system. By withdrawing their support, the Indian people hoped to stop completely the British in India and allow for the creation of an independent Indian nation. Hundreds of thousands responded to Gandhi’s plea and joined his civil disobedience campaigns, and the Indian National Congress quickly gained a mass following.<p></p><p></p>The situation in India was a powder keg waiting to explode. In 1927, rioting broke out when the British Parliament placed no Indians on a commission created to investigate the government of India. Soon after, the British imprisoned Gandhi and his associates but could not silence their message. In 1929, Jawaharlal Nehru was elected president of the Congress. Like Gandhi, Nehru was passionately devoted to the cause of independence. Finally in 1935, the British Parliament passed the Gov-ernment of India Act, which provided for elected legislatures in the provinces, but restricted the number of eligible voters based on property and educational requirements. Amid this growing agitation between the British colonial government and Indian peoples, Mother Teresa arrived to do her work.<p></p><p></p>THE SECOND WORLD WAR<p></p><p></p>Nonviolent resistance to the British in India continued to grow. By 1939, anti-British feelings intensified as the Indian people watched Britain once more plunge into hostilities with the Germans. The Parlia-ment, as it had during World War I, declared a state of war with Germany on behalf of the Indian people without consulting them.<p></p><p></p>The consequences of British actions were horrendous in India, result-ing in the Great Famine of 1942–1943. The transportation system was now taken over by the British military; even the small river crafts used to deliver rice to Calcutta from the paddies of Bengal were pressed into ser-vice. Burmese rice, which accounted for 10 percent of the staple food for Bengal, was cut off, causing a shortage. The Indian government, preoccu-pied by the war, saw the problem as one that needed to be solved locally.<p></p><p></p>Prices started to rise and both black marketers and money lenders pros-pered. Poor families in the rural areas, depleted of their meager savings, sold their land. With no food to eat, thousands fled the region for Cal-cutta, flocking to the city’s already overburdened soup kitchens. Housing for the poor was already overstretched, and thousands of people died in<p></p> 
ANSWERING THE CALL	25
<p></p>the streets everyday. Adding to the overcrowding and chaos were the swarms of refuges fleeing the Japanese. The noise of the streets was si-lenced only when people sought shelter from Japanese bombs. In the end, the Great Famine claimed the lives of at least two million, though some figures put the number of deaths closer to four or five million. The death toll was so high, that the traditional funeral pyres lit for the dead, known as ghats, never stopped burning in some areas.<p></p><p></p>The nuns at Entally felt the war’s effects, too. The number of war ba-bies or small infants left at the doorsteps of Loreto multiplied. At one point, Mother Teresa was faced with the problem of how to feed 24 babies by bottle. Orphans fleeing the Japanese came to the convent and school looking for refuge. The convent also opened its doors to other Catholic missionaries escaping from the Japanese.<p></p><p></p>In time, the British requisitioned the Entally convent and school as a British military hospital; the dormitories, which once housed orphans, were now taken over by sick, wounded, and dying British soldiers. The Sisters of Loreto evacuated, taking with them their students and other or-phans, and relocated to hotels in Darjeeling, Shillong, and Lucknow. Mother Teresa stayed in Calcutta in a building located on Convent Road. There she continued to teach and care for her young charges.<p></p><p></p>A CLOSE COMPANION<p></p><p></p>In 1937, Mother Teresa had taken on more responsibilities; she was put in charge of the St. Teresa’s Primary School as well as Sunday school classes for the children. During the war, she also took on the responsibili-ties of headmistress when Mother du Cenacle became ill in 1944. That she stayed in the city during the war made a tremendous impact on her students, for it was Mother Teresa’s wish that the lives of the children not be any more disrupted than necessary. The school may have been moved to a different location for the time being, but Mother Teresa worked to make sure that the children’s daily routine stayed as intact as possible.<p></p><p></p>It was during this period that Mother Teresa met a man who would serve as her spiritual advisor and companion for the next 45 years. Father Celeste Van Exem was a Belgian Jesuit who came to India in 1944. An ex-pert in Arabic and the Muslim faith, he came to Calcutta with the specific intention of working with the city’s Muslims. On July 11, 1944, he and two other priests moved into a house in Baithakana, located not far from Mother Teresa’s small community on Convent Road. When asked whether he would celebrate Mass for Mother Teresa, Father Van Exem re-called how he initially refused, stating that he was “called to India to work<p></p> 
26	MOTHER TERESA<p></p><p></p>for the Muslims and not for Sisters. I was a young priest who wanted to work with intellectuals; I did not want to be busy with nuns.”2<p></p><p></p>The following day, though, Father Van Exem met with Mother Teresa. His initial impression was of a very simple nun, concerned with the plight of the poor, but for the most part unremarkable. However, Mother Teresa came away with a much higher opinion of the priest, for not long after, she asked him to become her spiritual advisor. Again, Father Van Exem de-murred, saying that he had no desire to become a nun’s spiritual father and that he considered the request a diversion from what he believed to be his true reason for being in Calcutta. But he told Mother Teresa that she needed to put her request in writing to the archbishop of the city. The arch-bishop granted Mother Teresa’s request. In obedience to the bishop, Father Van Exem reluctantly assumed the role of Mother Teresa’s spiritual father and director. She would turn to him often for spiritual advice and direction.<p></p><p></p>WAR’S END AND TROUBLED TIMES<p></p><p></p>By 1945, the war ended and Mother Teresa and her charges moved back to the convent at Entally. During this period, Mother Teresa had written home to her mother describing her life in Calcutta. By now, Drana had moved to Tirana, Albania, where both Aga and Lazar lived. Drana reminded her daughter that she went to India to work with the poor; Drana also asked her daughter to recall the woman whom Drana had taken in, when no one else would. Perhaps this advice spurred Mother Teresa to rethink her duties in the convent.<p></p><p></p>No sooner had the hostilities ended with Japan, when India and Cal-cutta were once more plunged into hostilities and bloodshed. The Indian National Congress had been busy making preparations for India’s even-tual independence from British rule. Working with the Congress was the Muslim League, under the leadership of Mohammed Ali Jinnah, a lawyer. The League was pressing the Congress for the establishment of a separate homeland for India’s Muslims to be called Pakistan. The new country was to be formed from a partition of India.<p></p><p></p>On August 16, 1946, the Muslim League called a meeting—what members referred to as Direct Action Day—in Calcutta in the Maidan. The speeches given by league members inflamed an already passionate crowd. As a result, for the next four nights, the city was the scene of bloody riots between Hindus and Muslims. Life came to a grinding halt as the city was pitched into terror. Militants set fire to shops with people still inside. Sewers were filled with the bodies of the dead. Men, women and children, cut by the deadly blades of knives, were left in the streets to<p></p> 
ANSWERING THE CALL	27
<p></p>bleed to death. Entrails spilled onto sidewalks already red with blood; most everywhere one looked there were dead bodies, while vultures cir-cled overhead. By the end, at least 5,000 persons had perished and an-other 15,000 were wounded.<p></p><p></p>For Mother Teresa and the children, the riots also meant no food de-liveries. Faced with the prospect of her 300 students going hungry, Mother Teresa broke one of the cardinal rules of the order: she left the convent and went into the streets alone to search for food. Years later, Mother Teresa described the scene:<p></p><p></p>I went out from St. Mary’s Entally. I had three hundred girls in the boarding school and nothing to eat. We were not supposed to go out into the streets, but I went anyway. Then I saw the bodies on the streets, stabbed, beaten, lying there in strange positions in their dried blood. . . . A lorry [truck full] of soldiers stopped me and told me that I should not be out on the street. . . . I told them that I had to come out and take the risk. I had three hundred children with nothing to eat. The soldiers had rice and they drove me back to the school and unloaded bags of rice.3<p></p><p></p>In the aftermath of the riots, Mother Teresa became weak and ill and was directed to rest every afternoon for three hours. Her superiors feared that her condition might make her susceptible to tuberculosis, a malady that claimed many nuns in Calcutta. Father Van Exem remembered this pe-riod as the only time he ever saw his spiritual charge cry, frustrated at her weak condition and inability to carry out her duties.<p></p><p></p>Finally it was decided that Mother Teresa needed a spiritual renewal and a physical reprieve from the work at the convent and school. She was ordered to travel to the convent in Darjeeling for a retreat, which would allow her to rest and meditate. On September 10, 1946, a day that is now celebrated annually by the Missionaries of Charity as Inspiration Day, while traveling to Darjeeling on a dusty, noisy train, Mother Teresa expe-rienced another call. Later she would have little to say about the experi-ence, much as she did when she first received her calling to become a nun. But to one writer, many years later, she offered her memories of that train ride: “It was on the tenth of September 1946, in the train that took me to Darjeeling, . . . that I heard the call of God. The message was quite clear: I was to leave the convent and help the poor while living among them.”4 Many years later she also stated that the call was quite clear, “It was an order. To fail it would have been to break the faith.”5<p></p>

But there have been accounts of her life that have made erroneous connections between her desire to leave Loreto and her calling on the train to Darjeeling. One popular story stated that the killings and carnage she viewed during the August 1946 riots were the sole inspiration for her leaving. Another account incorrectly stated that she could view the slums of Calcutta from her bedroom window, which led to her decision.<p></p><p></p>Mother Teresa was no stranger to the poverty in Calcutta. She had seen it firsthand upon her arrival as a novitiate and later as a teacher instruct-ing the children of the poor. But until her train ride to Darjeeling, Mother Teresa firmly believed that she was carrying out God’s plan for her life and that she would best serve God as a nun living in Loreto. That was now all about to change.<p></p><p></p>THE FIRST STEPS<p></p><p></p>As Mother Teresa recalled “The message was clear, I knew where I be-longed, but I did not know how to get there.”1 On her return from Dar-jeeling, she immediately sought out Father Van Exem, showing him two sheets of paper on which she had written down her plans. Upon returning to his room at Baithakana, Father Van Exem placed the pieces of paper underneath a picture of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, which Mother Teresa had given to him as a Christmas gift. Two hours later, he returned and read the papers. He found the key ingredients as to what she was sup-posed to do: she was to leave Loreto, but she was to keep her vows. She<p></p> 
30	MOTHER TERESA<p></p><p></p>was to start a new congregation or order of nuns, who would work for the poor in the slums. The members of this new congregation would have to take a special vow of charity for the poor. There were to be no institutions, hospitals, or clinics to help in this endeavor. Mother Teresa and her nuns were to work and live among the poorest of the poor. Special attention, too, was to be focused on those people who had no family or were un-wanted in any way.<p></p><p></p>Father Van Exem did not even question Mother Teresa’s explanation. Years later, he stated that he believed her new vocation was just as true as her decision to leave Skopje and become a nun. To answer this latest call-ing, it did not matter to Mother Teresa that she had already made one sac-rifice in leaving her mother. Now she was fully prepared to make a second: leaving the safe confines of the convent at Loreto and venturing out into the streets of Calcutta to work with the poor.<p></p><p></p>When Mother Teresa returned to Loreto in October, she led a retreat in which the seeds of her new venture began to sprout. Drawing on the story of Jesus on the cross crying, “I thirst,” Mother Teresa put forth the basic tenets that would guide her journey: “to quench the infinite thirst of Jesus Christ on the Cross for love of souls.”2 The importance of this idea was so great that as her organization grew and built chapels, each one would be inscribed with the two words: “I thirst.” In creating the Mis-sionaries of Charity, she expected those chosen not only to take vows of chastity, poverty, and obedience, but to take an additional vow as well: to offer themselves to the poorest of the poor.<p></p><p></p>Leaving the convent was not easy for Mother Teresa. It was, she ad-mitted years later, the most difficult thing she had ever done, even harder than leaving her family and homeland. Besides the emotional turmoil, she still needed permission to leave. Upon consulting Father Van Exem, Mother Teresa decided to pray about her decision for a few months. In January 1947, Mother Teresa decided to write to Archbishop Ferdinand Périer about her plans; Father Van Exem would follow up with a visit.<p></p><p></p>If Father Van Exem thought that the archbishop would readily agree to Mother Teresa’s plans, he was mistaken. Years later, Périer described the first time he learned of Mother Teresa:<p></p><p></p>One day, as I was making the visit of the Entally convent, someone told me that a young nun of the Community had some queer ideas. Now, whenever anyone tried to put me on my guard in this way, I always asked my self whether the hand of God might not be there, and gave full freedom to the person<p></p> 
A NEW DIRECTION AND A NEW JOURNEY	31
<p></p>to explain his or her case. If the religious is humble, obedient, dutiful the impulse may come from God.3<p></p><p></p>Despite his open-mindedness, Archbishop Périer was not only against the idea of a lone nun living among the poor on the Calcutta streets, but he was also alarmed that one of his priests was apparently treating the idea with some seriousness. Soon after his meeting with Van Exem, the Archbishop ordered Mother Teresa transferred to Asansol, a city located about 175 miles northwest of Calcutta. Here, she was to maintain the kitchen as well as the garden; she would also continue teaching geogra-phy. Father Van Exem then cautioned Mother Teresa to say nothing more of her plans for the time being. The two kept up regular correspon-dence by mail.<p></p><p></p>A RELUCTANT APPROVAL<p></p><p></p>While Mother Teresa was away from Entally, Archbishop Périer made several inquiries about her. Keeping her identity a secret, he spoke with Father Julien Henry of St. Teresa’s Church, who also served as the pastor of St. Mary’s Church in Darjeeling and was a teacher of theology. The archbishop carefully asked Father Henry what he thought of a European woman dressed in the traditional sari of Bengali women, working among the poor and dying in the city. The two also discussed whether she could succeed and if such a new order would draw in young women to serve. Then there were political questions to be considered: what would the re-action of the public be to such an idea, when already there were individ-uals trying to help the poor?<p></p><p></p>Father Henry believed that the archbishop’s proposal was, in theory, possible. At the very least, it was a gamble, but Father Henry told the archbishop it was a gamble worth taking. Excited at the prospect of some-thing being done for the poor of Calcutta, Father Henry even asked his congregation to pray for the success of such a program. But little did he or anyone else realize that the person behind this idea was Mother Teresa. The archbishop was not finished. In addition to speaking with Father Henry, the archbishop sought the advice of the father general of the Soci-ety of Jesus (the Jesuit Order), who in turn asked the provincial in India for his thoughts. The archbishop also sought counsel from a specialist in church law.<p></p><p></p>There was another difficulty to be considered as well. The Vatican did not look favorably on the unnecessary growth of religious vocations for women. As it was, there were already too many small orders of nuns. A<p></p> 
32	MOTHER TERESA<p></p><p></p>bishop applying for a new congregation had to demonstrate that the ex-isting orders did not do the work for which the new one was being estab-lished. In Calcutta, the order of the Daughters of St. Anne, with whom Mother Teresa had worked while at the Loreto school, already ministered among the poor. They also dressed in Indian style, slept in a dormitory, ate simple food, and spoke Bengali. How would Mother Teresa’s new congre-gation be different?<p></p><p></p>The archbishop asked Mother Teresa if she could work with the Daughters of St. Anne. Mother Teresa did not think so. The Daughters had their own way of doing things and their own traditions. What Mother Teresa was proposing was quite different. Her congregation would be more mobile; they would visit the poor where needed. And she did not want just to work among the poor; she made it clear that she intended to work among the “poorest of the poor.”4 She also wanted to start from scratch and train her novices in her own way.<p></p><p></p>An entire year passed before the archbishop was satisfied with the in-formation he had received. Only then did he give permission to Mother Teresa to write to the mother general of the Loreto Sisters, asking for per-mission to be released from the Order. In the letter that Father Van Exem typed for her, Mother Teresa explained her reasons for seeking her release: she wished to continue her vocation among the poor. In asking the mother superior to leave, Mother Teresa requested exclaustration, which simply meant that she would continue to live by her vows but would serve as a Loreto Sister in a new setting.<p></p><p></p>However, when the archbishop read the letter, he insisted that Mother Teresa change exclaustration to secularization. To be secularized meant that Mother Teresa would no longer be a member of the Loreto Order, but she would continue to honor her vows as a nun. Having to leave the Loreto Order was a severe disappointment, but as Archbishop Périer explained, she was to trust God fully and send the letter.<p></p><p></p>With a heavy heart, Mother Teresa posted the letter to the mother gen-eral in Rathfarnham in early January 1948. Less than a month later, she had her reply:<p></p><p></p>Since this is manifestly the will of God, I hereby give you per-mission to write to the Congregation in Rome and for the in-dult. Do not speak to the Provincial. Do not speak to your Superiors. Speak to nobody. I did not speak to my own coun-selors. My consent is sufficient. However, do not ask for the in-dult of secularization, ask for the indult of exclaustration.5<p></p> 
A NEW DIRECTION AND A NEW JOURNEY	33
<p></p>The mother general could not have sent stronger support. Both Mother Teresa and Father Van Exem were overjoyed with the response. Mother Teresa now wrote another letter, this time to the office of the Vatican in Rome. Although the mother general told her to consult no one, Mother Teresa again gave the letter to Father Van Exem, who in turn gave it to Archbishop Périer. The archbishop again stipulated that if the letter was to be sent to Rome, Mother Teresa include her request for secularization. Despite her fears about having to leave her religious order, Mother Teresa was more worried about how to write to a cardinal. She asked Father Van Exem for help; he simply replied that a “Dear Father” would suffice and not to worry about titles, but to state her case clearly and simply. Finally in February 1948, she sent the letter to Rome. In addition to Mother Teresa’s request, Archbishop Périer also included a letter that outlined her life and service in Calcutta.<p></p><p></p>Weeks and then months went by with no response from Rome. Finally in July 1948, Archbishop Périer summoned Father Van Exem to his office. He had received news from the Vatican that very afternoon. Rome had granted Mother Teresa’s request for exclaustration. She would be allowed to remain a member of the Loreto Order and work outside of the convent. It was a wonderful victory for Mother Teresa and a vindication of the very principals that the Loreto Sisters’ founder, Mary Ward, had been denied. There was, however, one condition: Mother Teresa would remain outside the cloister for a year, at which time, the archbishop would review her progress and decide whether she would return to the convent.<p></p><p></p>The archbishop also made it clear to Father Van Exem that the news from Rome was not to be given to Mother Teresa until after the school week was completed. Despite Mother Teresa’s appeals to be told of the de-cision, the archbishop was adamant: she would be told the following Sun-day. An elated Father Van Exem agreed to the archbishop’s request.<p></p><p></p>On Sunday, August 8, 1948, Father Van Exem arose as usual and cele-brated mass in the chapel at the Loreto convent. Following his usual cus-tom, he gave the first sermon in Bengali, and then, after mass was concluded, another sermon in Hindi. He then asked Mother Teresa to meet with him in the convent parlor. When she arrived, he told her that he had received news from Rome. According to his account, Mother Teresa turned pale and requested to go to the chapel to pray. When she returned, he gave her the good news: not only did Rome agree to her request to leave the con-vent, but also that she continue her life as a Loreto Sister. She then signed three copies of the permission: one for Rome, one for the archbishop, and one for herself. She then asked, “Can I go to the slums now?”6<p></p> 
34	MOTHER TERESA<p></p><p></p>AN EMOTIONAL DEPARTURE<p></p><p></p>Despite Mother Teresa’s willingness to leave immediately to begin her work, there was still much to be done to prepare for her departure. First, she needed to inform the convent that she was leaving. Archbishop Périer had feared a shocked reaction from the sisters. His fears were justified. When the decree was made public, the mother superior took to her bed for a week. Another sister wept uncontrollably; many were shocked at the announcement or mystified as to why one of their own, particularly one who seemed happy in her surroundings, would want to leave the convent. Those close to Mother Teresa worried about her health and whether she could sustain a rigorous life on the Calcutta streets. A notice posted on a Loreto blackboard requested that the sisters not criticize or praise Mother Teresa, but pray for her and her decision.<p></p><p></p>In preparation for her departure from the convent, Mother Teresa pur-chased three saris from a local bazaar. Each one was white with three blue stripes; this simple garment would become the distinctive habit of her new order. The fabric was the cheapest available at the time, and was of the kind usually worn by poor Bengali women. The blue stripes held a spe-cial meaning for Mother Teresa, as the color is usually associated with the Virgin Mary. Father Van Exem later blessed the garments, along with a small cross and rosary, which had been placed on each garment in the St. Mary’s chapel while Father Henry and another nun watched. Among the last tasks that needed to be done required Father Van Exem’s help. Mother Teresa needed to write a letter to her mother, explaining all that had happened. She believed that if her spiritual advisor also wrote the let-ter, that would settle any fears or worries her mother might have about her daughter’s decision to leave Loreto.<p></p><p></p>Father Van Exem suggested that Mother Teresa take some medical training. Working in the slums, there would be plenty of opportunity to offer medical assistance. She agreed and decided to go to Patna in the state of Bihar where she would receive training from the Medical Mission Sisters at their hospital. Archbishop Périer supported the decision and Sister Stephanie Ingendaa, the mother superior at the hospital, warmly agreed to the request to help Mother Teresa in whatever way the sisters could.<p></p><p></p>On August 16, a week after learning of the Vatican’s decision, Mother Teresa changed her clothes. The long black habit, with its floor-length skirt, the white coif, and black veil were laid aside. She now wore her new religious habit, a symbolic breaking with the religious uniform she had worn for the past two decades. Even though many of her former pupils<p></p> 
A NEW DIRECTION AND A NEW JOURNEY	35
<p></p>wished to see their teacher in a sari, her leaving was a solitary affair. That evening, she left the convent grounds in a taxi as quietly as she had come almost 20 years before. In her pocket, she carried five rupees and a ticket to Patna.<p></p><p></p>A NEW BEGINNING<p></p><p></p>On August 17, Mother Teresa arrived at Patna, an old city located on the banks of the Ganges River. Sister Stephanie was there waiting to wel-come her. They went together to the Holy Family Hospital, where Mother Teresa would spend the next few months receiving her medical training.<p></p><p></p>The hospital and convent buildings were located in the poorer section of Patna, known as Padri ki Haveli (House of the Fathers), and was named after the first church built in the town. The Holy Family Hospital, which formerly served as a school building, was modest: two stories high with a small separate building to one side that housed the operating and delivery rooms. The hospital was staffed by nuns who were doctors, mainly gyne-cologists, obstetricians, and surgeons. Other nuns served as nurses, labora-tory technicians, and nutritionists. The hospital also housed a nursing school that many Indian girls attended.<p></p><p></p>The convent where Mother Teresa would take her meals and sleep oc-cupied part of the former church. Built of stone blocks, it had a high ceil-ing, a worn stone floor, small gothic-shaped windows, and whitewashed walls. The main part of the church was divided into small cubicles by bamboo rods and white cotton sheets. The garden was once the cemetery; on very hot nights, many slept between the tombstones covered with mosquito netting. The hopsital staff ate in the former servant’s quarters with an old Hindu cook maintaining the small kitchen.<p></p><p></p>Because the hospital was so busy, there was little fanfare to welcome Mother Teresa. Instead, she was put into a cubicle, given a chair in the dining room, and included in the day-to-day running of the hospital. Many of the sisters realized that she was in a period of transition, and while Mother Teresa knew what she was to do, she was still unclear about how she was to carry out her calling. In the meantime, the Medical Mis-sion Sisters tried to make her feel at home and helped prepare her for the grueling work ahead.<p></p><p></p>Now, instead of lecturing students, Mother Teresa’s days were filled with new experiences; she never knew what to expect from one day to the next. Whenever there was a new admission, an impending birth-or-operation, Mother Teresa was summoned at the same time as a doctor was<p></p> 
36	MOTHER TERESA<p></p><p></p>called. This experience not only gave Mother Teresa an opportunity to practice her Hindi, in which she was not very fluent, but to become ac-quainted with expectant mothers, fatal accidents, ill and abandoned chil-dren, and death on the operating table.<p></p><p></p>She also learned to tend to patients ill and dying with cholera or small-pox. One nun remembered that, no matter what the calamity, Mother Teresa remained unfazed by it, maintaining her focus on the patient. She could always be counted on to hold a dying patient’s hand, to comfort a small child frightened by the hospital, or to cradle a newborn infant in her arms. She learned how to do many simple medical procedures such as making a hospital bed, giving injections, and administering medicines. She helped assist in delivering babies, something in which she took spe-cial delight. Working with the nutritionists, Mother Teresa learned about the importance of a healthy diet, hygiene, and adequate rest. This knowl-edge was key to carrying out her work in the slums. As Mother Teresa came to know many of the poor families of the area, she attended wed-dings, feasts, and funerals, slowly entering their world and becoming one of them.<p></p><p></p>During her time at Patna, Mother Teresa gained her first associate. A young girl, suffering from advanced stages of tuberculosis, asked Mother Teresa whether she could help her in serving the poor. Toward the end of her stay at Holy Family, she appointed the young girl as an associate in her work. Her new helper ministered to other patients sick with tuberculosis and offered prayers for the recovery of those stricken with the disease. Un-fortunately, she did not accompany Mother Teresa to Calcutta for she died at Holy Family soon after.<p></p><p></p>BUILDING A FOUNDATION<p></p><p></p>During the evenings when not working at the hospital, Mother Teresa discussed her plans with the many members of the Medical Mission Sis-ters. She welcomed ideas, practical suggestions, and criticism from the others about how she should best implement her plans. One thing that did become clear: if Mother Teresa’s proposed order wanted to work with the poor, they would have to commit themselves to working only for the poor.<p></p><p></p>Out of these discussions came the foundation for Mother Teresa’s con-gregation as well as many of the rules and routines that the group would follow. Perhaps the most valuable lesson was the rule of balance as prac-ticed by the founding mother of the Medical Mission Sisters, Mother Anna Dengel. Like Mother Teresa, Dengal also had to obtain special per-<p></p> 
A NEW DIRECTION AND A NEW JOURNEY	37
<p></p>mission from the Vatican in order to establish an order of nuns who were also practicing surgeons and midwives. Among Mother Dengel’s tenets was that heavy tasks, physical or emotional, could not be carried out for long without rest and renewal. Therefore, it was imperative for her nuns to take regular rests when needed and retreats to recharge their bodies and minds.<p></p><p></p>The sisters suggested that with the poor living conditions and hard work that was to be done everyday, prayer should be strictly observed, but no prayer should be scheduled after 9 P.M. This would allow the nuns plenty of rest and relaxation. There should be plenty of protein-rich food for meals, especially at breakfast, but the selection should be simple; no exceptions to meals were to be made except in cases of illness. Mother Teresa had thought that she and her nuns would eat nothing more than rice and salt, the basic diet of the poor. But she learned that this diet was too sparse; she and her nuns would then be unable to work efficiently at their jobs. This kind of diet also left one open to the very diseases of the poor that Mother Teresa hoped to treat and fight. Mother Teresa sagely took the advice given to her.<p></p><p></p>Mother Teresa envisioned an eight-hour workday beginning at five in the morning. For that schedule to work, the Medical Missionaries sug-gested there be one daily hour of rest so that the nuns would have the en-ergy to carry out their tasks. They also suggested that one day a week should be taken off, usually a Sunday, but for those who worked Sundays, one full day of rest should be scheduled sometime during the week. There should also be an annual retreat for all, which took place away from their work. Clothing should remain simple; the Medical Mission Sisters wore white cotton habits and veils that were changed everyday, sometimes even twice a day. When Mother Teresa explained that the white cotton sari was to be the habit, the nuns suggested that for the sake of health, all saris should be washed everyday, and each nun should be given three saris: one to wear, one to wash, and one for special occasions and emergencies. Head coverings, while necessary to protect oneself from the hot Indian summers, were to be kept to a minimum with no starch used on any part of the headdress veil.<p></p><p></p>TIME TO LEAVE<p></p><p></p>After only a few weeks, Mother Teresa wrote to Father Van Exem ask-ing for permission to go to Calcutta. She felt she had learned all that she could for now, and was anxious to begin her work. Reading her request, Father Van Exem was skeptical. Mother Teresa had been with the Medi-<p></p> 
38	MOTHER TERESA<p></p><p></p>cal Mission Sisters for too short a time. He had fully expected her to stay much longer: at least six months, even up to a year. The archbishop felt similarly; both men wanted Mother Teresa to stay longer, to make sure she had taken advantage of every opportunity for her medical training.<p></p><p></p>Still, her letters kept coming, asking for permission to leave for Cal-cutta. She had learned all she could, plus receiving knowledge about dis-eases that she most likely would not encounter in the city’s slums. Further, she argued, she would learn more about cholera, sores, and other diseases that were prevalent in the slums if she were living and working among the poor who suffered from them. The Medical Missionaries agreed with Mother Teresa; it was time for Mother Teresa to begin her mission.<p></p><p></p>Not convinced, Father Van Exem traveled to Patna to meet with Mother Teresa and Sister Stephanie to discuss what was to be done. When he arrived at Holy Family, he looked for Mother Teresa, but could not find her in the group of nurses at the hospital. Finally, a small voice answered, “But Father, I am here.”7 Father Van Exem, having never seen Mother Teresa in her sari, completely overlooked her.<p></p><p></p>Meeting with Sister Stephanie and the sister-doctor who had been overseeing Mother Teresa, Father Van Exem listened as the two explained why it was time for Mother Teresa to leave. She was ready to begin her life in the slums they told him, and they would always be there should she need advice or direction in medical matters. Father Van Exem then ex-plained that both he and the archbishop were concerned about the possi-bility of a church scandal should Mother Teresa fail in her mission. She would not make a mistake, the sisters assured him, and again they re-minded him that there were others who would share in the responsibility of her undertaking. Finding himself outnumbered, Father Van Exem re-lented: Mother Teresa could go to Calcutta.<p></p><p></p>NOTES<p></p><p></p>Navin Chawla, Mother Teresa: The Authorized Biography (Rockport, Mass.: Element, 1992), p. 21.<p></p><p></p>Kathryn Spink, Mother Teresa (San Francisco: Harper & Row, 1997), p. 24.<p></p><p></p>Edward Le Joly, Mother Teresa of Calcutta: A Biography (San Francisco: Harper & Row, 1977), pp. 10–11.<p></p><p></p>Le Joly, Mother Teresa, p. 12.<p></p><p></p>Spink, Mother Teresa, p. 29.<p></p><p></p>Eileen Egan, Such a Vision of the Street: Mother Teresa—The Spirit and the Work (Garden City, N.Y.: Image Books, 1986), p. 35.<p></p><p></p>Spink, Mother Teresa, p. 33.<p></p> 
<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Chapter  4<p></p><p></p>OUT OF A CESSPOOL—HOPE<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Shortly after his visit with Mother Teresa and the Medical Mission Sis-ters, Father Van Exem wrote to Mother Teresa that the archbishop had re-lented and given his permission for her to return to Calcutta. He had also found a place for her to live with the Little Sisters of the Poor. She arrived at the St. Joseph’s Home for the elderly, located at 2 Lower Circular Road, on December 9, 1948. It had been barely four months since she had left the Loreto convent in Entally and started her training in Patna. Prior to her leaving Patna, Mother Teresa spoke with one of the nun-doctors in the cemetery of the convent grounds. Remarking that she had no idea how she was going to proceed or where she would even begin, Mother Teresa nonetheless remained confident that God would direct her. And with that thought, she made her way back to Calcutta to undertake her life’s work.<p></p><p></p>Although Calcutta had the third highest per-capita income in India, it was a vast sea of suffering and despair. The streets, where people were born and died hourly, were crowded with beggars and lepers, together with a host of refugees from the countryside who had never known a home. Unwanted infants were regularly abandoned and left to die in clinics, on the streets, or in garbage bins. There were thousands of pavement dwellers within the city itself; 44 percent of the city did not have sewers. It was into this sea of misery that Mother Teresa now came.<p></p><p></p>The St. Joseph’s Home proved to be a good choice for Mother Teresa. The Little Sisters of the Poor lived in strict poverty. Although they worked through other institutions, they had no regular source of income<p></p> 
40	MOTHER TERESA<p></p><p></p>to draw on and were completely dependent on donations of food and money. This dependence on God and the charity of others became an im-portant element with the Missionaries of Charity as well. Although the mother superior was at first unsure about whether Mother Teresa could stay at the St. Joseph’s Home, Father Van Exem assured her that Mother Teresa had received a decree of exclaustration and that she was still an-swerable to the archbishop.<p></p><p></p>Upon her arrival, Mother Teresa made a short retreat under Father Van Exem’s guidance. They decided to meet every morning; she would spend afternoons in prayer and meditation. She also spent part of her time dur-ing those first days at the convent helping the sisters care for their aged patients.<p></p><p></p>MOTIJIHL<p></p><p></p>On December 21, 1948, Mother Teresa left her small room on the first floor near the gate of St. Joseph’s and went to mass. After break-fast, she left the convent grounds and boarded a bus bound for Mauli Ali to begin her work. She was dressed in her white sari, but she wore it not as a poor Bengali woman but instead wrapped around her head covering a tiny cotton cap. Completing her habit was a small black cru-cifix, attached to her left shoulder by a safety pin. Under her rough leather sandals, a gift from the Patna sisters, she wore no stockings. With a meager lunch in a small packet she entered the world of the Calcutta slums.<p></p><p></p>Her first stop was in the slum of Motijihl, which means “Pearl Lake.” While there was no lake, there was a large brackish sump in the center of the neighborhood that provided the area’s residents with water. Raw sewage flowed into open drains and garbage lay piled on the streets. The slum’s residents lived in small hovels with dirt floors. There was no school, no hospital, and no dispensary.<p></p><p></p>Motijihl was already a familiar place for Mother Teresa. Though she had never personally visited it, many sodality students at St. Mary’s, under Father Henry’s direction, had come to work in the area. Father Henry was more than eager to offer help to Mother Teresa and provided her with a list of families whose children had attended the school at the Loreto convent. Mother Teresa visited with as many families as she could. She told them she had permission to start a school right in the area. As a result, several parents promised to send their children to her the next morning.<p></p> 
OUT OF A CESSPOOL—HOPE	41
<p></p>BEGINNING RIGHT ON THE GROUND<p></p><p></p>The next morning, Mother Teresa was back in Motijihl and was happy to see several children waiting for her on the steps of a railway bridge that led down into the slum. In trying to find a spot where they could meet, Mother Teresa noticed that the only open area was a tree near the sump. With no blackboard, chalk, books, or desks, Mother Teresa took a stick and used it to write in the mud. As the children squatted and watched, she traced the letters of the Bengali alphabet with the stick. Mother Teresa had made a start, or as she would later describe it, beginning “right on the ground,”1 which became one of the defining concepts of the con-stitution of the Missionaries of Charity.<p></p><p></p>Soon the number of pupils attending classes multiplied as word spread that a school had been started in Motijihl. In time, the sounds of children reciting the alphabet competed with the other everyday noises of the slum. When morning lessons were finished, Mother Teresa looked for someplace to eat her small lunch, seeking out a quiet spot where she could find drinking water. Once, when she stopped at a local convent to ask if she could come inside to take her meal, the nuns, thinking Mother Teresa was a beggar, refused. Instead, they directed her to the back to eat under the stairs where the other beggars ate. In later years, she would never mention the name of the convent that had turned her away.<p></p><p></p>Mother Teresa became a familiar, if strange, sight on the Calcutta streets: many watched as the lone woman, dressed like a poor Indian, spent her time visiting in the alleyways and mean streets of the slums. Even one of her strongest supporters, Father Michael Gabric, a Jesuit priest from Yu-goslavia and a member of the missionary group whose actions first influ-enced Mother Teresa as a young girl, was puzzled by her actions. He candidly admitted in an interview, “We thought she was cracked.”2<p></p><p></p>At the request of the archbishop, Mother Teresa kept a record of her early efforts, dating from December 25, 1948 until June 11, 1949. Only a small part of this fascinating record survives. These pages are her accounts of her first days working in Motijihl, especially with the children. Chil-dren who were dirty were given a bath. After lessons in hygiene and read-ing, she helped the children learn their catechism. She noted especially the joy the children gave her, remembering how she laughed when teach-ing them.<p></p><p></p>There were also entries in which Mother Teresa described moments when humor was of a darker nature. Attending to one poor man who had a gangrenous thumb, Mother Teresa realized that the thumb would have<p></p> 
42	MOTHER TERESA<p></p><p></p>to be amputated. Saying a prayer and taking a pair of scissors, she snipped it off. Her patient then fainted in one direction and she in the other. She often gave her bus fare away to those who needed it more and, instead, walked home.<p></p><p></p>THE DARK NIGHT<p></p><p></p>Although the remaining pages of her journal document the people and situations that she saw and even the feelings she had while doing her work, it is still hard to imagine the tremendous loneliness that Mother Teresa must have felt as she made her way through the slums of Calcutta in those first months. For someone who had been accustomed to the order and peace of convent life, the reality must have been jarring. But Mother Teresa’s faith in God was absolute, and so she kept up her work, despite the exhaustion and pain she felt at the end of the day.<p></p><p></p>Her faith also kept Mother Teresa from falling into despair, for she sensed that her work accomplished very little. Calcutta faced intractable problems. Since winning independence from Great Britain, India had been divided into two nations: Muslim Pakistan and Hindu India. De-spite the creation of a separate country for Muslims, conflict between them and the Hindus continued, sometimes erupting into bloody vio-lence, which left families devastated and areas ravaged. Many Hindus seeking jobs flooded the streets of an already-overcrowded Calcutta. Most ended up in the streets, and with a growing shortage of food and water, many were plunged into unrelenting poverty. Much of the food and water available became contaminated from the overflowing sewage. Many considered the acquisition of one rupee (about 11 cents Ameri-can) as good fortune.<p></p><p></p>Still, Mother Teresa persevered. As people heard of what she was doing, they came forth with money, supplies, time, and favors. The bus driver who drove the route to St. Joseph’s made her sit in a seat next to him so she should would not have to make the hour-long walk back to St. Joseph’s. A former teacher at St. Mary’s came to help her teach classes. On one occasion, she went to a local parish priest for help. As much as he said he was glad to be of service, he offered her little in the way of encourage-ment or help. Mother Teresa then went to another priest who was so de-lighted with what she had accomplished, that he presented her with a gift of 100 rupees to help carry on her work. It was a princely sum that allowed Mother Teresa to rent two small huts in Motijihl for five rupees each. One hut served as a school where the students met for class and where they were given milk at lunchtime and free bars of soap as prizes.<p></p> 
OUT OF A CESSPOOL—HOPE	43
<p></p>The infectious enthusiasm of the children spread throughout the com-munity. Here and there, people came forward with small gifts for the school: a stool, an odd table, even books and slates appeared. By January 4, 1949, less than two weeks after she first set out, Mother Teresa had a schoolhouse, over 50 students, and three teachers to help her. Not only were the children learning their alphabet and numbers, but classes in needlework were offered for the young girls as well as the continuing em-phasis on teaching the children hygiene and catechism. The school was soon formally blessed. It was one of Mother Teresa’s greatest successes.<p></p><p></p>The other hut on the premises was used for a more solemn purpose: car-ing for the ill and dying poor, a place where Mother Teresa offered com-fort, solace, and, above all, dignity to those who had no home and no hope. Her reasons for creating the small hostel arose out of one of her many experiences in dealing with the poorest of the poor. One day, Mother Teresa saw a woman dying on the street beside a hospital. She picked the woman up and took her to the hospital but was refused admis-sion because the woman had no money. The woman later died on the street. Mother Teresa then realized that she must make a home for the dying.<p></p><p></p>Still, she was plagued by doubt about whether she was doing the work God had called her to do. There were moments when she wished to return to the quiet and security that the Loreto convent offered. On one occa-sion when she approached a priest for financial aid, he treated her as if she were doing something wrong by begging, telling her to ask instead her own parish priest for money. He left her saying he did not understand and brusquely turned away. The experience reduced Mother Teresa to tears and raised grave self-doubts. She would later say that God was training her; but in order to carry out His will, she had to feel completely useless and inadequate to the task before her. Continually, she struggled to turn her will aside and place her faith completely with God in the hope that He would continue to show her the way. She later wrote of this period as the “dark night of the birth”3 of her order, the Missionaries of Charity.<p></p><p></p>But in her begging for food, medicine, clothing, and money, Mother Teresa was actually carrying out a time-honored tradition of mendicancy. Throughout much of India’s history, priests, holy men, and teachers de-pended on the support of the community for their livelihood. Her begging letters and begging expeditions were a natural outgrowth of her own poverty and a dependence on providence to provide for her basic needs and the needs of those she helped. Although in some western cultures such overt dependence is often looked down upon, in India, as well as in tradi-tional Roman Catholic practice, begging was nothing to be ashamed about.<p></p> 
44	MOTHER TERESA<p></p><p></p>14 CREEK LANE<p></p><p></p>During her first months on the Calcutta streets, Mother Teresa’s spiri-tual advisor, Father Van Exem, watched carefully to see how she was hold-ing up. After talking, both he and she decided that it was time for her to have a place of her own where she could start her work and no longer im-pose on the Little Sisters of the Poor. But Mother Teresa’s first efforts to find affordable housing met with little success. Often landlords would not keep their appointments. Others, upon seeing the strange European nun with no visible means of support, refused outright to rent to her. Mother Teresa did not lose heart, but identified her plight with that of the people she served. She later wrote:<p></p><p></p>Our Lord just wants me to be a “Free Nun,” covered with the poverty of the Cross. But today I have learned a good lesson— the poverty of the poor must often be too hard for them. . . . I walked and walked till my legs and arms ached. I thought how they must also ache in body and soul, looking for home, food, help.”4<p></p><p></p>Father Van Exem finally stepped in. He spoke to a member of a Bengali Catholic family, Albert Gomes, who, along with his brothers, owned a sizeable property at 14 Creek Lane in East Calcutta. One brother, Michael Gomes, lived in the house with his family. Finally an agreement was reached in which Mother Teresa would move into a room on the second floor. She would pay no rent. The home’s location was later described by Mother Teresa as “rich in its poverty.”5<p></p><p></p>In February 1949, she moved into her new quarters, bringing with her only a small suitcase. Her room was spartan in appearance: a single chair, a packing case for a desk, and some extra wooden boxes for seats. The wall was adorned with an image of the Virgin Mary, a gift from Father Van Exem who had originally received it from Mother Teresa as a Christmas gift years before.<p></p><p></p>Mother Teresa now had some helpers who accompanied her so that she would not be alone in the slums. Charur Ma, a widow who was the cook at St. Mary’s at Entally, often went with her on shopping trips. Mable Gomes, the young daughter of the family with whom she boarded, also went with Mother Teresa on occasion. Even Michael Gomes, when he had time, went with Mother Teresa to chemists’ shops, similar to Ameri-can pharmacies, to ask for donations of medical supplies. Father Van Exem sent a parish worker to accompany her on some of her daily visits to the poor and dying. She was even joined by some of her former students<p></p> 
OUT OF A CESSPOOL—HOPE	45
<p></p>who came to visit her. Seeing her in her sari, some burst into tears. But all were glad to see her and to offer what help they could.<p></p><p></p>Many years later, Michael Gomes recounted some of his experiences helping Mother Teresa. On one rainy afternoon, Mother Teresa and Mable Gomes returned from the slums. Both were soaking wet, and Mother Teresa apologized for Mable’s condition. She told Michael that they had just come from a home where they found a woman standing in a room without a roof. Knee-deep in water, the woman had held an enamel washbasin over the head of her sick child to protect him from the rain. The landlord had broken the roof deliberately because the woman had been unable to pay her rent for the last two months, owing him a total of eight rupees. Later that afternoon, Mother Teresa hurried back to give the woman her rent money.<p></p><p></p>On another occasion, when Michael accompanied Mother Teresa on one of her begging forays, they again encountered rainy weather. Watch-ing from the train window, they saw a man, completely drenched, slumped under a tree. The two hurried to finish collecting medicines and went back with the hopes of helping the man. However, when they reached him, he was already dead. As Gomes later recounted, Mother Teresa was in anguish over the incident, and the fact that many other poor and gravely ill men and women, like the unknown man, might have wanted to say something to someone, to have some comfort in their final hours. The incident hardened her resolve to search for a facility where the terminally ill could die in dignity and peace.<p></p><p></p>Gomes also remembered giving Mother Teresa extra food whenever there was any to spare. Often she would ask him for extra mugs of rice, which she gave away to starving families. Still, from time to time, she en-countered hostility. Gomes remembered when a group of passengers on a train, remarking on her strange nun’s habit, said that she was nothing more than a Christian hoping to convert Hindus. For a long time, Mother Teresa listened in silence. Finally she turned to them and said, “Ami Bharater Bharat Amar” (I am Indian and India is mine).6 The passenger car was silent for the rest of the trip.<p></p><p></p>“IT WILL BE A HARD LIFE”<p></p><p></p>On March 19, 1949, the feast day of St. Joseph, foster father of Jesus and the protector of the Virgin Mary, a young girl appeared at 14 Creek Lane. Subashni Das had been a boarder at St. Mary’s at Entally since she was a small girl, and had been one of Mother Teresa’s students. She was now in the last year of secondary school. She had come to join Mother<p></p> 
46	MOTHER TERESA<p></p><p></p>Teresa in her work. Mother Teresa remarked, “It will be a hard life. Are you prepared for it?”7 The young woman said yes, and in doing so became Mother Teresa’s first postulant, taking the name of Agnes, Mother Teresa’s Christian name. She would, in time, become Mother Teresa’s closest aide: she replaced Mother Teresa as the mistress of novices, the nun who over-sees the training of new nuns, and took over the duties of the mother su-perior when Mother Teresa began traveling.<p></p><p></p>Some weeks later, another former student Magdalena Gomes also came to the house. She, too, wished to join Mother Teresa in helping the poor. She took the name of Sister Gertrude and became the order’s first doctor. By Easter of that year, the three women were sharing the tiny quarters at the Gomes’s home and traveling everyday to Motijihl. They lived as nuns, though the Church had not yet recognized them as a formal religious order.<p></p><p></p>Soon, two more women arrived to join them. By the beginning of sum-mer, there were 10 young women, all former students of Mother Teresa, living at the Gomes’s home. Since none had graduated from school, Mother Teresa made sure that they completed their studies and that they all passed their final exams. Of the original 10, only 2 eventually left. The others went on to become some of the first novitiates of Mother Teresa’s Missionaries of Charity.<p></p><p></p>To make room for the new arrivals, the Gomes’s opened the upper room, which was really more like a large loft. The group used one area of the room as a chapel. Father Henry donated a wood altar and candle-sticks. Above the altar was the picture of the Virgin Mother that Father Van Exem had given to Mother Teresa.<p></p><p></p>Mother Teresa instituted a schedule for the young women. Each morn-ing, they were awakened by a bell, which also summoned them to meals. The same bell also signaled periods of prayer, rest, and work. Every morn-ing, clad in their saris, the young women and Mother Teresa left for the poorest areas of Calcutta. The days followed a set routine: mornings were spent teaching school, while afternoons were given to the sick and dying. By this time, there were two schools to tend to: the first one in Motijihl and another in the slum of Tiljala, where Mother Teresa rented another small room for her new students.<p></p><p></p>The young women and Mother Teresa also established a dispensary, which was located in a classroom in the local parish school. After school hours, the large room was turned into a screening room for tuberculosis patients. The classroom, which opened onto a veranda, was often the scene of long lines of people waiting to be examined. The nuns tried to get the most seriously ill into city hospitals. However, when necessary, they<p></p> 
OUT OF A CESSPOOL—HOPE	47
<p></p>cared for the sick on the spot as they lay in the streets and alleys of the city.<p></p><p></p>Mother Teresa worried about her charges. Remembering the advice of the sisters at Patna, she was especially concerned that they were getting enough to eat. Michael Gomes remembers one instance in which Mother Teresa, sitting in the back of a truck with some bags of rice and flour, re-turned at the end of the day from one of her begging expeditions. She had not eaten all day nor gotten any water for fear that someone would steal the food meant for her postulants. She went without in order that the food would be delivered safely to the house.<p></p><p></p>To help the sisters, Father Van Exem and Father Henry made an an-nouncement at Sunday mass calling for mushti bhikka, a Bengali custom where any families that were able put aside a handful of rice for a beggar. This effort marked the start of the feeding program that the Missionaries of Charity oversaw and that would in time include not only food, but clothing and soap for the poor.<p></p><p></p>A YEAR’S END<p></p><p></p>And then the first year was over. On August 16, 1949, Mother Teresa’s year of exclaustration came to an end. Now Archbishop Périer had to de-cide whether she would remain outside the cloister of Loreto or return. By this time, the archbishop had received reports of Mother Teresa and her growing band of young women. In his mind, there was no turning back for Mother Teresa; she would remain outside of the cloister. If she had re-turned, the young women would have disbanded. They were not recog-nized as a formal order of nuns; they were simply a group of very religious women who happened to be living with a rather unorthodox nun. A course that would allow Mother Teresa to continue her work with her as-sistants would be to accept them as a congregation for the diocese of Cal-cutta answerable to the archbishop just as Mother Teresa was. This was a real possibility since the little group now numbered more than 10, the re-quired number needed to begin a new congregation.<p></p><p></p>Still, the archbishop remained cautious. Before making any decision, he needed to know if there had been any negative reports about Mother Teresa and her work. He went to Father Van Exem, who admitted that there had been one report, that of an old Jesuit who believed Mother Teresa was doing the work of the devil. He had gone to the mother supe-rior at Loreto, asking her why a woman who was doing such a fine job as a teacher in an established school would leave to wander about the slums of Calcutta. The archbishop, so incensed by the comments, insisted that the<p></p> 
48	MOTHER TERESA<p></p><p></p>priest in question immediately apologize to the superior for his criticism of Mother Teresa and her work.<p></p><p></p>While Mother Teresa awaited the archbishop’s decision, she took an-other very important step: she applied for and was granted Indian citizen-ship. The act was a potent one, signifying not only her break with her European roots, but a pledge to become one with the people she served. By the end of 1949, the archbishop had become so supportive of Mother Teresa and her efforts that he stated his willingness to recognize her group as a congregation in his archdiocese. The final approval would have to come from Rome, but the archbishop was willing to make the journey himself and plead Mother Teresa’s case on her behalf. He planned to go to Rome in April 1950 to present the Vatican with the necessary documents.<p></p><p></p>Now Mother Teresa struggled with a draft of the proposed order’s con-stitution, which outlined the rules by which the nuns would live. She wrote of her spiritual calling on the train ride to Darjeeling and outlined the first three vows all would take when coming into the order: poverty, chastity, and obedience. To these she added a fourth vow: “to give whole-hearted and free service to the poorest of the poor,”8 which would become known as “our way.”9 She also decided on a name for the new order: the Missionaries of Charity.<p></p><p></p>She turned over her draft to Father Van Exem, who worked on it, tight-ening up the language, as Mother Teresa’s grasp of English was not good. Father Van Exem forwarded the document to a priest who specialized in canon, or church, law. Then five copies were made and taken to the arch-bishop who presented the documents to Cardinal Pietro Fumosoni-Biondi, head of the Office for the Propagation of the Faith for the Catholic Church. The Vatican accepted the constitution, even with the fourth vow, which over time brought many to the order and quieted even the most skeptical. On October 7, 1950, the church had a new congrega-tion in its fold: the Missionaries of Charity, headed by Mother Teresa.<p></p><p></p>DRAWING ON THE PAST FOR THE FUTURE<p></p><p></p>The new constitution of the Missionaries of Charity may have been polished by the priests of the church, but the document reflected the spirit of Mother Teresa. In it, she not only outlined why she believed what she was doing was so important and the specific vows for her new order, but also some basic rules that the Missionaries of Charity continue to follow today. She began by stating the goal of the order:<p></p><p></p>Our aim is to quench the infinite thirst of Jesus Christ for love by the profession of the evangelical counsels and by whole-<p></p> 
OUT OF A CESSPOOL—HOPE	49
<p></p>hearted free service to the poorest of the poor, according to the teaching and the life of our Lord in the gospel, revealing in a unique way the salvation of God. . . . Our particular mission is to labor at the salvation and sanctification of the poorest of the poor. . . . We are called THE MISSIONARIES OF CHAR-ITY.10<p></p><p></p>Mother Teresa wished to see the vow of poverty rigorously applied. She wrote:<p></p><p></p>Whoever the poorest of the poor are, they are Christ for us— Christ under the guise of humans suffering. . . . Our food, our dress; it must be just like the poor. The poor are Christ himself. We should not serve the poor like they were Jesus. We should serve the poor because they are Jesus.11<p></p><p></p>Mother Teresa sought to reinforce the vow of poverty in other ways, too. In the constitution of the order it is stipulated that at no time will the Missionaries of Charity own any buildings or other property. Postulants were to be members of the Roman Catholic Church, which would pre-serve the very core of the congregation. However, in time it became clear that because the church was not a strong institution in India, that this stipulation would have to be modified. Still, the core tenets of the consti-tution for the new congregation showed the influence of those groups that had the greatest impact on Mother Teresa’s own life, from the missionary efforts of the Jesuits who swore devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus and obedience to God, and also to the Loreto Sisters who stressed a similar de-votion and obedience to carrying out the work of the Lord on earth.<p></p><p></p>The last matter that needed to be attended to was the question of the sisters’ dress. Sent to Rome were three photographs: one depicting a pos-tulant in a plain white sari and short-sleeved habit, the second of a novice in a white sari and habit with sleeves that entirely covered the arm, and last a picture of Mother Teresa in the sisters’ dress of white sari with the distinctive blue border. The new style of dress, while unorthodox, was ac-cepted.<p></p><p></p>A NEW BEGINNING<p></p><p></p>On October 7, 1950, Archbishop Périer came to the house at 14 Creek Lane for the first time to celebrate mass at the altar located in the tiny chapel on the second floor. A large number of persons assembled to hear Father Van Exem read the decree of erection recognizing the Missionaries<p></p> 
50	MOTHER TERESA<p></p><p></p>of Charity as a new congregation limited to the diocese of Calcutta. That same day, 11 young women began their lives as postulates of the new order. It was a joyous occasion for all.<p></p><p></p>Over the next two years, 29 young women joined Mother Teresa. All took up residency on the second floor of the Gomes’s house, which res-onated with their activity. Mother Teresa wrote in her journal of the trust, surrender, and cheerfulness of the newcomers. She observed with special pride how dutifully they accepted the vow of poverty required of them.<p></p><p></p>It was not an easy life. The novices washed their clothes and their bod-ies using communal buckets. They cleaned their teeth with ashes and slept on thin pallets. Their meager pile of garments consisted only of their cotton saris, coarse underwear, a pair of sandals, a crucifix pinned to the left shoulder, a rosary, and an umbrella to protect them from the monsoon rains. All these items were packed in a small bundle (potla), which they used as a pillow.<p></p><p></p>To celebrate the completion of the new nun’s postulancy, or taking of vows, Father Van Exem created a special ceremony. The novices came to the cathedral dressed as Bengali brides. During the service, they went to a room where Mother Teresa cut their hair. This practice represented a tremendous sacrifice, as many Bengali girls regarded their long hair as a great gift. The women’s hair was often so long that the entire process took several hours to complete. They then reappeared in their religious habits as novices. It was a beautiful ceremony and one that Mother Teresa com-pletely approved for its incorporation of high church ritual with the local culture. Father Van Exem remembered with some amusement the reac-tion of the locals to the first ceremonies of this kind: “The ordination of a priest takes two hours, the consecration of a bishop three hours, the re-ception of a Missionary of Charity four hours!”12 Not everyone, however, was pleased at the spectacle of young Bengal brides who were in fact not really married but had entered into the Catholic Church.<p></p><p></p>It was soon apparent that the quarters at Creek Lane were becoming too small for the growing number of sisters. Father Van Exem and Father Henry once again went to work searching for new quarters for the order. One of the first nuns to join the order remembered how Mother Teresa and her nuns helped the two priests:<p></p><p></p>Father Henry organized a procession every evening. He ac-companied the sisters as we went through the Calcutta streets saying the rosary aloud. . . . And from six to nine, we went on the road from our house to St. Teresa’s Church and hence to Fatima Chapel, praying there and again on our way home. We<p></p> 
OUT OF A CESSPOOL—HOPE	51
<p></p>were asking our Lady of Fatima to obtain for us the new house we needed.13<p></p><p></p>Finally, a suitable house was found at 54A Lower Circular Road. The home, which belonged to a former Muslim magistrate, was bought by the diocese of Calcutta with the understanding that Mother Teresa would pay back the loan. In February 1953, Mother Teresa and her group moved into their new residence. In tribute to their founder, the sisters called it Motherhouse.<p></p><p></p>NOTES<p></p><p></p>Eileen Egan, Such a Vision of the Street: Mother Teresa—The Spirit and the Work (Garden City, N.Y.: Image Books, 1986), p. 43.<p></p><p></p>Egan, Vision, p. 43.<p></p><p></p>Raghu Rai and Navin Chawla, Faith and Compassion: The Life and Work of Mother Teresa, (Rockport, Mass.: Element, 1999), p. 39.<p></p><p></p>Rai and Chawla, Faith, p. 38.<p></p><p></p>Kathryn Spink, Mother Teresa: A Complete Authorized Biography (San Francisco: Harper & Row, 1997), p. 38.<p></p><p></p>Rai and Chawla, Faith, p. 40.<p></p><p></p>Rai and Chawla, Faith, p. 40.<p></p><p></p>Egan, Vision, p. 48.<p></p><p></p>Rai and Chawla, Faith, p. 42.<p></p><p></p>Edward Le Joly, Mother Teresa of Calcutta: A Biography (San Francisco: Harper & Row, 1977), p. 28.<p></p><p></p>Mother Teresa with Jose Luis Gonzàles-Balado, Mother Teresa: In My Own Words (New York: Gramercy Books, 1996), pp. 24, 30.<p></p><p></p>Spink, Mother Teresa, p. 43.<p></p><p></p>Le Joly, Mother Teresa, p. 30.<p></p>

<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Chapter  5<p></p><p></p>“RIGOROUS POVERTY IS OUR SAFEGUARD”<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Lower Circular Road is a humming center of activity in Calcutta. The street is filled with pedestrians and traffic. The everyday drone of people, car horns, rickshaw bells, and trams is broken occasionally by the passing of Hindu processions and political parades. With all the commotion, it is easy to overlook the residence located at 54A Lower Circular Road; the noise of the everyday world drowns out the daily prayers of the home’s res-idents.<p></p><p></p>To get to 54A Lower Circular Road, one takes a narrow lane that leads to a three-storied, gray-washed building. On closer inspection, however, one sees that there are really two houses that surround a small courtyard. Leaving the lane takes one to the front brown-painted door; here is a small chain attached to the frame, which, when pulled, rings a bell on the inside. The bell is an acknowledgement of the power outages that often plague Calcutta. Once inside the home, the visitor is in a very special place: the center of activity for the Missionaries of Charity and their now-deceased founder, Mother Teresa.<p></p><p></p>POOR BY CHOICE<p></p><p></p>With their move into Motherhouse in early 1953, the Missionaries of Charity had their own base of operations. Not only did the new residence offer more room for the growing number of newcomers to the order; it also had its own chapel and a dining hall. Mother Teresa also had her own quarters. Slowly, new recruits appeared asking to be taken into the con-gregation as a Missionary of Charity.<p></p> 
54	MOTHER TERESA<p></p><p></p>Despite the spacious new surroundings, Mother Teresa was determined that her congregation live a life shaped by extreme poverty. They would not deny themselves the necessities; however, they would reject with kind, but firm, graciousness any offers of material goods from the well in-tentioned, as they were seen by the order as luxuries. “Our rigorous poverty is our safeguard,” Mother Teresa said. She later explained that the Missionaries of Charity did not want to do what other religious orders had done throughout history—that is, to begin by serving the poor, but end-ing up servicing the rich, and themselves. “In order to understand and help those who have nothing, we must live like them. . . . The only differ-ence is that they are poor by birth and we are poor by choice.”1<p></p><p></p>In the early days of the order, maintaining the vows of poverty was not that difficult. Besides their meager possessions, the sisters soon learned how to beg for their needs as well as the needs of the poor. However, the poor came first and the needs of the order second. Still, that period was filled with a number of stories, many of them humorous, as the sisters learned to improvise given their situation and their mission.<p></p><p></p>Finding properly fitting shoes was a continual challenge for the nuns. On one occasion, Mother Teresa allocated the same pair of sandals to three different sisters, all of whom were in desperate need of footwear. On another occasion, the only pair of shoes available for one sister to wear to church services was a pair of red stiletto heels. However, she chose to wear them and the sight of her hobbling was the source of much amusement for many days.<p></p><p></p>Articles of clothing were also at a premium; habits were made out of old bulgur wheat sacks; sometimes the labels were still visible under the thin cloth cover of the white saris, even after repeated washings. One sis-ter’s habit clearly bore the label Not for Resale under her sari. One Christ-mas, there were not enough shawls for the sisters to wear to Midnight mass; instead those without wore their bed covers.<p></p><p></p>JOINING THE ORDER<p></p><p></p>When Mother Teresa first established the Missionaries of Charity, she worked hard to help prepare the young women who entered the order. Fa-ther Van Exem and Father Henry also helped instruct the newcomers in preparation for their lives as nuns. Gradually, these tasks became more the duties of senior nuns. Mother Teresa always emphasized that the work of a Missionary of Charity was no different from that of social workers. This is not completely true; social workers, while working with the disadvan-taged, often try to help correct the social ills that cause poverty in the first<p></p> 
“RIGOROUS POVERTY IS OUR SAFEGUARD”	55
<p></p>place. For Mother Teresa and her nuns, living among the poor and living like the poor was a means to find God and bear witness to his presence and his will.<p></p><p></p>Women who apply to join the order must meet four requirements. They must be physically and mentally healthy. They must have the abil-ity and the desire to learn. Common sense is a necessity as is a cheerful disposition; they would need all they could muster in working with the poor. Initially, women enter the order for only a few weeks or months; in this way, they can see if they are truly meant to become a Missionary of Charity. As in other religious vocations, some find the life too dismal or too hard. Others decide to leave and marry. Women who choose to re-main do so with the understanding that they will sever ties with their fam-ilies. Rarely are they allowed to return home, though periodic visits are allowed every 10 years or so; in the case of a family illness, permission is given for the sister to go home. Often, if the nun is to be sent to a mission abroad, she is allowed to visit family members before leaving.<p></p><p></p>When joining the order, a young woman spends the first six months as an aspirant and the following six months as a postulant. This period also offers an opportunity for those who wish to leave to do so. The next two years are spent as a novitiate; again if one chooses to leave the order, she may do so without receiving special permission. At the end of the two-year period, the novitiates take their first vows. The next five years are known as the juniorate; from then on, each year the candidates renew their vows in order to strengthen their spiritual commitment to God and the order. For those wishing to leave, special permission is now required from the head of the order. The sixth year is known as the tertianship; be-fore taking their final vows, the nuns are sent home to visit with their families and to reflect upon whether they are ready to assume the duties and life of a Missionary of Charity. When asked once about what she ex-pected of her nuns, Mother Teresa replied:<p></p><p></p>Let God radiate and live His life in her and through her in the slums. Let the sick and suffering find in her a real angel of com-fort and consolation. Let her be the friend of the little children in the street. . . . I would much rather they make mistakes in kindness than work miracles in unkindness.2<p></p><p></p>LIFE AT MOTHERHOUSE<p></p> 
<p></p>The daily routine for those who chose to be Missionaries of Charity was long and grueling. Weekdays, the sisters rose at 4:40 A.M. to the call of<p></p> 
56	MOTHER TERESA<p></p><p></p>Benedicamus Domino (“Let us bless the Lord”) and the response of Deo Gratias (“Thanks be to God”). Dressing at their bedsides with a sheet cov-ering their heads, they went downstairs to wash their faces with water that came from the courtyard tank and was carried in empty powdered milk cans. They then collected ash from the kitchen stove to clean their teeth. Each sister washed herself with a small bit of soap; this same bit of soap was used to wash their clothes as well. Between 5:15 A.M. and 6:45 A.M. the sisters went for morning prayers, meditation, and then mass. They then went to the dining hall where each drank a glass of water before breakfast. In the beginning, there was no tea for breakfast; instead milk made from American powdered milk was given. Breakfast consisted of five chapattis (homemade bread made from wheat or other grain flours and baked without yeast) spread with clarified butter (ghee). The chapattis pro-vided strength and energy to the body and it was required that all eat their allotment, something that many had a harder time doing than going with-out food. Father Henry once told a story of how, when the first newcom-ers joined the order, they came with the expectation that food would be insufficient and one of many deprivations they would suffer. At their first meal, Mother Teresa put their plates before each one. Amazed, the women looked at the plates full of food. They were told to eat it, as it was their due. Mother Teresa then reminded them that God “wants obedience rather than victims.”3 In addition to their food, all of the residents took a vitamin pill with their meal. After their quick breakfast, the sisters were out on the streets by 7:45 A.M. to begin their work. The sisters made a point of traveling together in pairs for their own safety as well as to help one another.<p></p><p></p>In the parlor of the Motherhouse is a hand-drawn chart that lists the various activities the sisters are to do. These included providing child wel-fare and educational programs and operating nutritional daycares; family planning centers; dispensaries; leprosy clinics; rehabilitation centers; shelters for the homeless, crippled and mentally disabled; homes for unwed mothers; and hospices for the sick and the dying. A separate col-umn notes the total number of these institutions and the number of peo-ple who benefited from them. A world map with red pins denoted the areas where the Missionaries of Charity established homes or foundations. In time, Missionaries of Charity in Western Europe and the United States offered family visits and a prison ministry. The Missionaries of Charity’s emphasis in India and many Third World countries—besides helping to educate the poor and tend the dying—came to be on homes for alco-holics, shelters for the homeless, soup kitchens, and hospices for AIDS pa-tients.<p></p> 
“RIGOROUS POVERTY IS OUR SAFEGUARD”	57
<p></p>By noontime, many sisters returned to Motherhouse for prayers and a midday meal, which consisted of five ladles of bulgur wheat and three bits of meat if there was any available. After the meal, housework was at-tended to and then came a rest of 30 minutes. Afterward, there was more prayer and afternoon tea at which the nuns ate two dry chapattis. There followed another half-hour of spiritual reading and instruction from Mother Teresa. The sisters then returned to the city.<p></p><p></p>By 6 in the evening, the sisters returned to the Motherhouse for prayers and dinner, which usually consisted of rice, dhal (a spicy dish made with lentils), tomatoes, onions and various seasonings, and other vegetables. During the meal, there was also 10 minutes of spiritual readings. After dinner, attention was given to darning and mending, using a razor blade, needle, and darning thread kept in a cigarette tin. There was also time for recreation; this was the one time that conversation about subjects other than work was permitted. The signal for this recreational conversation to begin was Laudetur Jesus Christus (“Praise be Jesus Christ”), to which the sisters answered “Amen.” Now was the time that all could share what happened to them during the day. Then at 10 o’clock, the day was over; and everyone retired for the night.<p></p><p></p>Because Sundays were often as busy as weekdays, Mother Teresa set aside Thursdays as days of respite for the residents of Motherhouse. On this day, the sisters might engage in prayer and meditation. Quite often in the early days, Mother Teresa would take her group to the home of a Cal-cutta doctor, where they would have a picnic and relax on the grounds.<p></p><p></p>The physical demands of the sisters’ work were strenuous. On any given day, they might have to jump railway tracks or ditches or slog through pools of standing water. During the rainy seasons, there was the danger of being caught in a flash flood. Mother Teresa instructed her nuns always to say their rosaries that each sister carried with her. In time, mea-suring distances covered was not added up in miles, but in how many rosaries were said. When the conditions they encountered were desperate or terrible, the Sisters sang High Mass in Latin.<p></p><p></p>Even with the emphasis on poverty, there were times when the sisters went without necessities. When there was no fuel to cook their meals, the sisters ate raw wheat that had been soaked overnight. When their curry was too bitter and there was nothing available to improve its taste, the sis-ters ate it for the sake of the conversion to Catholicism of the Mau Mau tribe in Africa. No matter the sacrifice, the sisters did it willingly and often with smiles on their faces.<p></p><p></p>Not all welcomed Mother Teresa and the Missionaries of Charity into their lives. Some of the poor resisted the sisters’ efforts to help them, see-<p></p> 
58	MOTHER TERESA<p></p><p></p>ing them as trying to convert the poor to Catholicism. Others simply did not want charity. For those young women who offered their lives in ser-vice to the poor, rejection also waited. Many girls’ families were ashamed of their vocation to help the poor and outcasts of the city. In some cases, family members, if coming upon a daughter or sister who had become a Missionary of Charity, crossed the streets or turned away to avoid looking at them. Many parents urged their daughters to leave and were often dis-appointed and surprised to hear their advice rejected.<p></p><p></p>THE JOY OF BEING POOR<p></p><p></p>Throughout the early years of her congregation’s existence, Mother Teresa continued to work hard. Up before any of her nuns and often toil-ing long after they had gone to bed, she never ceased to work. There was always something to do, whether it was persuading those with much to part with some of their goods, overseeing the everyday activities of the Mother-house, or writing a history of the congregation. She appeared tireless, full of good cheer and ready to move on to the next task. For members of her congregation, she was nothing short of a marvel. As one sister explained, it was as if the constitution of the congregation was being acted out before their eyes. Mother Teresa exemplified for the order the joy of being poor, working hard, and having strong faith in God’s providence.<p></p><p></p>No task was too menial or disgusting for Mother Teresa to undertake. One sister, repelled at the thought of cleaning the toilet, hid herself away. Mother Teresa passed by, not noticing the Sister in the hall. Seeing the state of the toilet, she immediately rolled up her sleeves and cleaned the toilet herself. The sister never forgot the experience and applied herself more fully to her tasks.<p></p><p></p>From all the sisters, Mother Teresa asked obedience. Those unable to eat the allotted five chapattis a day were not considered Missionaries of Charity material and were asked to leave. Other requirements of the order included speaking English at all times. Those who came to the order with-out finishing their studies were to complete them in addition to their work at the Motherhouse.<p></p><p></p>The nuns made other sacrifices in the face of cultural taboos. For in-stance, realizing that the congregation needed people with medical train-ing, Mother Teresa asked some of the first sisters to earn medical degrees even though studying medicine meant mixing with men under conditions of unacceptable intimacy. Nevertheless, the women did as they were asked even though it meant being further ostracized from their families and cultural traditions.<p></p> 
“RIGOROUS POVERTY IS OUR SAFEGUARD”	59
<p></p>Mother Teresa asked nothing of others that she would not do herself. She worked with her sisters and was protective of their well being. She also continued to trust that God would meet the needs of the congrega-tion. This faith and devotion to God often rewarded Mother Teresa and her sisters in amazing ways. On one occasion when there was no food in the house, a knock came at the door. A woman standing outside had with her bags of rice. She later told Mother Teresa that she did not have any in-tention of going there, but for some reason came bringing the rice. That evening, Mother Teresa and the sisters had their dinner.<p></p><p></p>In another instance, Father Henry asked Mother Teresa for some money to print some leaflets. She searched the house and found only two rupees, which she gladly turned over to Father Henry. As he was leaving, he remembered a letter that he had brought for her. Opening it, Mother Teresa discovered a gift of 100 rupees. When a newcomer arrived at the Motherhouse, there was no pillow available for her; Mother Teresa offered the young woman hers, but the sisters refused to allow it, stating that she needed the pillow for her own rest. Mother Teresa insisted and while doing so, an Englishman appeared at the Motherhouse with a mattress. He was leaving the country and wanted to know if the sisters would have any use for his mattress. This and other events demonstrated to Mother Teresa the power of faith as well as God’s providence when people com-pletely surrendered their lives into his care.<p></p><p></p>As the sisters soon learned, there was great joy to be had from small things when living the life of the poor. One of the first Christmas holidays celebrated by the group was an example. One sister recalled how on Christmas morning the sisters awoke to find that the dining area had been decorated with streamers and balloons; by each place at the table was a white paper bag with a sister’s name on it. Inside of each bag were letters from home and gifts from Mother Teresa. All the sisters received pencils; one remembered gifts of a bar of soap, a clothes peg, St. Christopher and Miraculous Medals, sweets, and a balloon. The sister remembered how thrilled she was by the gifts and Mother Teresa’s generosity toward her congregation.<p></p><p></p>REACHING OUT<p></p><p></p>By 1953, the work of the Missionaries of Charity had grown tremen-dously. On April 12, 1953, the initial group of Missionary Sisters took their first vows in Calcutta’s Roman Catholic Cathedral; during the same ceremony, Mother Teresa took her final vows as a Missionary of Charity. She also now succeeded Archbishop Périer as superior of the order she<p></p> 
60	MOTHER TERESA<p></p><p></p>had founded. Despite his early resistance to Mother Teresa’s efforts, the archbishop had demonstrated his full support in the order’s early years, be-lieving, as many others did, that God’s hand clearly was at work in his city.<p></p><p></p>In time, Mother Teresa and her sisters became a familiar sight in the streets of Calcutta. As news of their endeavors spread, Mother Teresa was asked on occasion to speak about her work. As a result, many groups and organizations pledged their aid to carry out the work of the Missionaries of Charity. It took time, but soon doctors, nurses, and other lay people were volunteering their time and skills to help Calcutta’s poor. As the number of volunteer medical personnel increased, so did the number of dispen-saries to help tend to the sick and dying. Mother Teresa was also able to increase the number of schools in the slum areas; with more teachers, more poor children had the opportunity to learn how to read and write. Even the City of Calcutta eventually relented: whenever there were 100 pupils studying with the Missionaries of Charity in one area, the city agreed to build a small school building for them.<p></p><p></p>Despite these strides, Mother Teresa felt that still she and her congre-gation were not doing enough to help the growing numbers of poor. In the wake of Indian independence, conditions had worsened throughout India and particularly in Calcutta. Malnutrition and overcrowded living condi-tions contributed to even more illness and suffering. Even the governing body of the city, the Calcutta Corporation, was powerless to help.<p></p><p></p>In the 3,000 official slums in the city, there resided more than two mil-lion persons. The overcrowded conditions forced many to seek shelter on railway platforms, in alleyways, or on city streets. Prisons were overflow-ing and hospitals had to turn away people because they had no room. Even with the help of relief organizations, the city struggled to take care of the problem. As a result, the sick and the starving, weakened by disease and hunger, simply dropped wherever they were to die. To many, Mother Teresa and her nuns were but a small trickle of hope in a growing sea of suffering.<p></p><p></p>THE MISSIONARY OF CHARITY WAY<p></p><p></p>Confronted with the changes that the Roman Catholic Church faced as a result of Pope John XXIII’s Second Vatican Council from 1962 to 1965, many of the Church’s religious orders struggled to find their place in the changing world. The pope’s goal was to revitalize the church, and he believed that changes in the liturgy and in some of the rules govern-ing religious orders would make an effective beginning. However, in the wake of the Second Vatican Council, many religious orders not only im-<p></p> 
“RIGOROUS POVERTY IS OUR SAFEGUARD”	61
<p></p>plemented changes, but tried to make the religious vocations more meaningful and pertinent to keep in step with the twentieth century. Not everyone welcomed these changes; some orders preferred the old ways.<p></p><p></p>Beginning in the 1970s, many religious orders underwent dramatic transformations as the Catholic Church struggled to become more mod-ern and accessible to its followers. For some women’s religious congrega-tions, these changes meant modifying the nun’s habit, and in some cases completely forgoing it. Many nuns believed that if one was to be of gen-uine service in the world, then one must wear the clothes of the real world. Others believed that by leaving behind their religious habit, which was often viewed as a barrier to working with the public, they would make people feel more comfortable around them. The practice of doing away with the religious uniform also encouraged individuality among the order’s nuns, and hopefully along with it, one’s particular talents. Others eased their rules in order to attract potential applicants to their order, es-pecially those women with backgrounds in social services, medicine, or other advanced degrees.<p></p><p></p>However, in the case of the Missionaries of Charity, Mother Teresa made virtually no concessions; even today, the order continues to attract many young women who wish to take the vows of extreme poverty and give their lives over to the service of the poor. Everything about the life of a Missionary of Charity emphasizes the long-held ideal of caring feminin-ity; that is, the traditional role of women as caretakers subservient to men. It is an ideal that also asks one to suppress one’s own will for the common good. The image is a particularly potent one in Western culture, where a woman in a nun’s habit ministering to the needs of the ill and poor is seen as the epitome of female selflessness, despite the efforts of the modern-day women’s movement to counteract this image.<p></p><p></p>Even the manner in which Mother Teresa spoke of her order reinforced this ideal. To Mother Teresa, she and her nuns were the wives of Christ crucified, their bond to God like a mystical marriage; she described the love that the Missionaries of Charity professed for Jesus in terms similar to the love between husband and wife. This is an even more dramatic con-trast to the thinking of many of today’s religious orders, who find the no-tion of a nun as a bride of Christ not only outdated, but ridiculous.<p></p><p></p>In establishing the Missionaries of Charity, Mother Teresa also made it clear that she would brook no interference from priests, or meddling, no matter how well-intentioned, from outsiders. She also deflected any ad-vice about how to teach her nuns. This rigid sense of control has had some impact on the order. Although one can understand the decision not to<p></p> 
62	MOTHER TERESA<p></p><p></p>have televisions in the homes of monastics, it was harder for outsiders to understand the absence of newspapers or magazines; in fact, there is little in the way of reading material at any of the homes. Being informed about world events, Mother Teresa thought, was a distraction. She preferred to put her trust in God, who would make known to her all that she needed to know. What books were available for the nuns tended to be of a reli-gious nature, such as books on piety or the lives of the saints. Except for the nuns who became medical doctors, Mother Teresa did not want her sisters to be any better informed or educated than those they were trying to serve, a startling contrast to orders that encouraged their members to seek advanced college degrees or specialized training.<p></p><p></p>This practice drew a great deal of criticism from within the Church. Some officials believe that education is necessary, not just the knowledge of theology but also of secular disciplines. Mother Teresa’s attitude to-ward education is especially puzzling since she herself valued education. Perhaps she came to regard education, like wealth and worldly goods, as a source of vanity that the devout ought to sacrifice to the glory of the Lord.<p></p><p></p>Mother Teresa left her imprint on almost every aspect of the order. The old-fashioned discipline and rigid obedience required was and is today, more than some can bear. Some did not like being told what to do all the time. Others felt that even as the women grew older and more senior in the order’s hierarchy, they were often forced to maintain a student-teacher relationship with Mother Teresa. For many, that clearly was no longer appropriate and had the effect of preventing the women from growing up. Some even felt uncomfortable using the term “Mother” as it denoted a childish dependence on Mother Teresa, which she en-couraged.<p></p><p></p>Others, though, found themselves drawn to the Missionaries of Char-ity precisely because they did not have to grow up and make difficult de-cisions that adulthood requires. The black-and-white life of the order is such that those who are immature will have an easier time coping with its rigors than those who are prone to questioning and learning. This is in contrast to what was taking place in other orders, as rules became more re-laxed and nuns allowed to make more of their own decisions. The reforms of Vatican Council II, ironically, also contributed to a drop in vocations. In 1990, the number of women in religious orders had dropped by more than half, from a record high of almost a million women serving as nuns in 1970. Today, third-world vocations continue to increase, while in the West, the numbers continue to decline.<p></p> 
“RIGOROUS POVERTY IS OUR SAFEGUARD”	63
<p></p>THE INCULTURATION OF POVERTY<p></p><p></p>One of the greatest challenges that faced Mother Teresa, and that con-tinues today, was the difficult balance of realism and idealism. In some cases, the Missionaries of Charity, in their zeal to serve the poor, have made some questionable choices. In one instance the sisters removed a ra-diator from a house because the poor had no heat in their homes. Ac-cording to a nun who is a member of the Sisters of Sion, the act was<p></p><p></p>patronizing to the poor. . . . We are learning from the poor, the way we should respond to the poor is that we are in this to-gether. Some of us are emotionally poor or poor in education. Of course you can deprive yourself but I have had the opportu-nities of a good education, there I’m a rich person; we must recognize that and not play at being poor. You can live along-side the poor but you must also be realistic.4<p></p><p></p>While Mother Teresa and her nuns adapted to life among the poor in India and later in other Third World countries, when it came time to es-tablish homes in the West, the order often faced a different set of circum-stances. To what extent should the order inculturate, that is adapt to the culture of the poor in the West, which is often very different from that in the third world. For instance, in establishing a shelter for women in the United States, did the sisters have an obligation to make sure that the women they helped not only received housing and meals, but also help to navigate the extensive red tape of the various social agencies to find aid, jobs, or other support services? The Missionaries of Charity would say no; that their vows do not extend to doing this type of work. However, there are those in the Church who would come to feel otherwise.<p></p><p></p>In one instance, Mother Teresa’s rigorous attitude toward austerity for her order made headlines. In San Francisco, the order was given a former convent. When Mother Teresa arrived at the house, she was very un-happy, telling the bishop that the house was too big and elegant for their purposes. As a result, the mattresses, carpets, and many pieces of furniture were thrown out of the house into the street. A boiler that provided hot water was also taken out. Some in the order believed the matter could have been taken care of more discreetly and were unhappy at the ruckus the incident caused. On another occasion, Mother Teresa scolded her nuns for storing some canned tomatoes. She lectured them, reminding them that the order did not store food, but relied on God to provide for them.<p></p> 
64	MOTHER TERESA<p></p><p></p>A HOLISTIC WHOLE<p></p><p></p>The theology that Mother Teresa followed is rooted in Church teach-ings prior to Vatican II. This doctrine emphasizes the spirit over the flesh; as such, it is the spirit that must be taken care of first. This attitude stressed the glory of suffering, as the human body was often identified as weak and sinful. Modern Catholic theologians have modified this view and speak of the importance of good health for both body and soul. Glo-rified suffering serves no purpose and is thought to be an evil in which no good is found. To suffer is only good if there is a purpose and the possibil-ity of turning it into something worthwhile.<p></p><p></p>For Mother Teresa, by contrast, suffering was the expected path one must travel in order to reach heaven. This attitude helps explain how such places as Nirmal Hriday, which became the home for the dying, would be run. In caring to the very ill and dying, Mother Teresa was draw-ing on the traditional practice of offering solace and comfort instead of medical aid. This practice dates from the medieval period when religious orders ran hospices for pilgrims or sanctuaries for the poor. There was, at best, limited medical care available; what the sisters did in these places was help to prepare the dying person’s soul for heaven.<p></p><p></p>By the nineteenth century, this attitude underwent a dramatic trans-formation with sisters such as Mother Mary Aikenhead, founder of the Irish Sisters of Charity, whose work helped lay the foundation for the modern hospice movement. There were others too such as Dame Cicely Saunders or Sister Frances Dominica, who helped change the way that re-ligious orders treated the seriously ill and dying. Their work is often over-shadowed by Mother Teresa and the Missionaries of Charity, whom many in the West believe had done the most to transform the way the dying are cared for. In India and other Third World countries, there is little choice in how one dies. Because of that, Mother Teresa’s work had been elevated and in some cases misunderstood. It was an approach that would make her an easy target in later years.<p></p><p></p>But for now, many of these criticisms were far in the future. Clearly, the Missionaries of Charity had struck a resounding chord within the Cal-cutta community. For Mother Teresa, there was still much to do. She and her order had only just begun their work.<p></p><p></p>NOTES<p></p>

<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Chapter  6<p></p><p></p>KALIGHAT<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>On a rainy day in 1952, a young boy, no more than 13 or 14 years old, lay dying on a neighborhood street. He appeared to be one of the many beg-gar children who are found in the streets of Calcutta. Naked and emaci-ated, the boy’s limbs looked more like matchsticks than arms or legs. A concerned resident called the ambulance, which took the boy to a nearby hospital. The hospital, already overcrowded, refused to help. Instead, the boy was dumped in a Calcutta street gutter where he died alone and un-known. At some point the city sent a van or a cart to haul the body away. Although such scenes were common in Calcutta, a local newspaper picked up the story of the dead boy and heightened public attention to the dying poor.<p></p><p></p>Mother Teresa was no stranger to the problem. In the increasing num-ber of talks she gave to the public about her congregation, she related a very similar story. One day, when she and another sister were just begin-ning their work, they encountered what appeared to be a bundle of rags lying on a street. As they approached, they realized, to their horror, that the bundle was not just rags, but a middle-aged woman, half-conscious, her face half-eaten away by rats and ants.<p></p><p></p>Together, Mother Teresa and her companion carried the woman to the nearest hospital. The nurses refused to take the woman, claiming the hos-pital had no beds. When Mother Teresa asked hospital officials where she could go, they told her to take the woman back where she had found her. Frustrated, Mother Teresa refused to leave until she had a promise that the hospital would make room for the sick woman. In the end, hospital authorities relented and gave the dying woman a mattress on the floor.<p></p> 
68	MOTHER TERESA<p></p><p></p>She died a few hours later with Mother Teresa by her side. It was then, Mother Teresa told her audiences, that she had decided to find a place for the dying and take care of them herself.<p></p><p></p>ASKING ONLY FOR A PLACE<p></p><p></p>“When Mother Teresa began her work in the slums,” recalled one sis-ter, “we often found people dying or sometimes dead.”1 When possible, the sisters took the ailing person to the hospital, where more often than not they were turned away. Often there was no place to take them at all, leaving the sisters unable to offer anything else except comfort and com-pany until the person died. At one point, Mother Teresa rented two rooms for five rupees each in the Motijihl slum. But the space, only eight feet square, could not even begin to hold the numbers of dying people who needed help; at best only two to three persons could be accommodated, leaving little room for the sisters to tend to them. When one of the pa-tients died during the night, the others, now fearful, fled. Undaunted, the sisters continued to bring the sick and dying to the two rooms, while pray-ing that they could find a larger building adequate to their needs.<p></p><p></p>Mother Teresa also realized that, if she were to realize her goal of es-tablishing a home for the dying, then she needed more than prayers. De-termined, she went to the city’s Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Ahmed. Explaining her desire to him, Mother Teresa promised that if he would help her find a place, she would do the rest. The doctor, well aware of Mother Teresa’s growing reputation, treated her request seriously. By of-fering to help, Mother Teresa and her nuns would be relieving some of the already heavy burden the city faced in dealing with dying people on the streets.<p></p><p></p>In fact, Dr. Ahmed knew of a place that might perfectly suit Mother Teresa’s needs. Together they went to inspect a building, which had been used as a pilgrim’s hostel near the Temple of Kali, the Hindu goddess of death and fertility. Located in the Kalighat district, the temple was situ-ated near the banks of the Hooghly River. The site was popular among the Hindus who came to worship at the temple. According to legend, Kali’s father made a sacrifice in order to guarantee the birth of a son. Unfortu-nately, the gift did not include an offering to Shiva, Kali’s husband. In-sulted by the slight to her husband, Kali committed suicide. Shiva, desolate over the death of his wife, carried her in his arms, threatening de-struction wherever he went. To save mankind, another god, Vishnu, hurled a discus at Kali’s corpse. The body shattered, falling in pieces to the ground, which is now considered sacred.<p></p> 
KALIGHAT	6 9
<p></p>Of all the consecrated ground, the most sacred was the area where the toes of Kali’s right foot lay. On that spot, a temple to the goddess was built. Over time, the temple was surrounded by streets bearing pictures of the deity and became an important and symbolic center of worship for Hindus throughout India. Some came to fulfill a vow; others journeyed seeking cure for an illness. Still others came to celebrate important cere-monies such as naming rites for infants, marriages, or cremations on one of the funeral pyres located near the temple. The religious importance of the temple of Kali was so great that many Hindus wished to be cremated there.<p></p><p></p>The building that Dr. Ahmed showed Mother Teresa consisted of two great rooms set at right angles and linked by a passageway. Calcutta offi-cials had received complaints that squatters were misusing the building, and so wished to have someone occupy it to save it from further destruc-tion. Besides the large, airy rooms, there was also electricity, gas for cook-ing, and a large enclosed courtyard where patients could take the air and sun and where clothes and bedding could be hung to dry. Mother Teresa decided on the spot that she would accept the building; the doctor, acting on behalf of the city, agreed to let her have it provisionally. When asked later why she accepted the doctor’s offer, she explained that since the building was associated with the famous Hindu temple and that pilgrims used to come to rest there, so would the dying before continuing their final journey to heaven. Almost immediately, Mother Teresa and several of her nuns and novitiates set to work. The quarters had fallen into terri-ble condition and needed to be cleaned from top to bottom to make them ready for the new arrivals.<p></p><p></p>NIRMAL HRIDAY<p></p><p></p>On August 22, 1952, the pilgrim’s hostel opened under the name Nir-mal Hriday, which is Bengali for Pure or Immaculate Heart. Since it opened on the day that celebrates the Virgin’s Immaculate Heart, the building was named in her honor. To make ready for the patients, the nuns had placed low cots and mattresses on ledges in both the large rooms, which, when filled to capacity, would hold 30 men in one room and 30 women in another. But Mother Teresa and her helpers did not have much time to contemplate this latest offering from Providence. They soon took to the streets in search of the hopelessly ill and suffering who had no place to go.<p></p><p></p>Early on, Mother Teresa laid down some rules for Nirmal Hriday. No leprosy patients would be admitted. This was done to allay the fears of<p></p> 
70	MOTHER TERESA<p></p><p></p>other patients who might refuse to come or try to leave. Mother Teresa also instituted these rules to calm the fears of the local residents and pil-grims who lived near or worshipped at the temple. It was implicitly un-derstood that people from all religious creeds and races would be welcome at Nirmal Hriday. Mother Teresa also decided that only patients refused by city hospitals, of whom there were many, would be admitted. Soon, city ambulances made their way to the doors of Nirmal Hriday to deliver pa-tients whom the city’s hospitals had rejected. But Mother Teresa and the other nuns continued to search the streets for the ill and dying, whom they transported to the home in a wheelbarrow.<p></p><p></p>Those brought to Nirmal Hriday were given medical treatment when-ever possible. Patients who were beyond saving received the last rites ac-cording to their faith; for Hindus, this meant water from the nearby Ganges on their lips; for the followers of Islam, readings from the Koran (the Islamic holy book); for those who were Catholic, confession and communion. While recovery from their ailments was cause for thankful-ness, the primary goal of Nirmal Hriday was to offer those who were dying a chance to pass away in peace and dignity. As Mother Teresa once stated, “A beautiful death is for people who lived like animals to die like angels— loved and wanted.”2<p></p><p></p>A MISSION UNDER FIRE<p></p><p></p>Not everyone was pleased about the creation of Nirmal Hriday. Al-though Mother Teresa believed the hostel’s proximity to the shrine was beneficial for the dying, residents of the area as well as visitors to the shrine, felt differently. Many believed that having a home for the dying nearby defiled the temple grounds. As Father Van Exem remembered, the situation was full of bitter irony. Even though the home for the dying was near a temple honoring a deity of death, “people did not want the dying to come there actually to die.”3 Many days, Mother Teresa and her nuns faced angry demonstrators shouting at them to leave. On several occa-sions, protestors threw stones at the nuns. There were even death threats made against the Missionaries of Charity and Mother Teresa. A man once threatened to kill Mother Teresa as she was making her way to the home. She did not move and told the man that if he killed her, she would only reach God sooner. The man let her pass.<p></p><p></p>Other Hindus complained that in tending to Hindu patients, Mother Teresa and her nuns were also trying to convert the dying to Christianity. The Brahmins (upper-class Indians), who served as temple priests, wrote regularly to the city of Calcutta, complaining about Nirmal Hriday, asking<p></p> 
KALIGHAT	7 1
<p></p>the city to evict the tenants. They argued that the agreement made with Mother Teresa was only provisional, and that she and her patients be re-moved from the area as soon as possible.<p></p><p></p>Finally, Dr. Ahmed, accompanied by a police officer, went to Nirmal Hriday to see for themselves what was really going on. As they entered the building, they saw Mother Teresa pulling maggots from the flesh of a pa-tient. The stench was so overwhelming that the two men could barely stay in the room. Dr. Ahmed heard Mother Teresa telling the dying pa-tient to say a prayer from his religion and she would say a prayer from hers. Together, she said, they both have offered something beautiful to God. When she turned and saw the two men, she offered to show them around the home. The police officer, with tears in his eyes, said no, that there was no need to see anything else. Upon returning to the demonstrating crowd outside, the policeman spoke and said that he would remove Mother Teresa from the premises, but only if the women of the neighborhood came in to continue her work. Although the visit from Dr. Ahmed soothed the situation somewhat, hostility remained toward the home and the nuns, especially from the Brahmin priests, who continued to petition the city to remove Mother Teresa, her nuns, and the patients from the hostel.<p></p><p></p>Then, one day, a young priest at the temple, who had been one of Mother Teresa’s most vocal critics, fell ill. Vomiting blood, he was diag-nosed with the last stages of tuberculosis. No hospital would admit him, and so it was that he came to Nirmal Hriday to die. He was given a place in a corner and the nuns lovingly tended him. He died not long afterward. When the other Brahmin priests learned what had happened and how he had been treated by the Missionaries of Charity, their hostilities subsided. They realized then what others were learning too: the nuns at Nirmal Hri-day took care of all who came with a love and tenderness and asked for nothing in return.<p></p><p></p>LIFE AT NIRMAL HRIDAY<p></p><p></p>Like the Motherhouse on Lower Circular Road, daily life at Nirmal Hriday had a routine all its own. Anyone could enter Nirmal Hriday just by walking through the door. The large open rooms remained divided into two wards: one for men, the other for women. A simple board hung in the hall listing the number of men and women currently being treated at Nir-mal Hriday. In the beginning, the dying were laid on the black marble floor. Soon, though, each room contained three rows of low iron beds, with two rows resting on a raised platform. Behind each bed a number was<p></p> 
72	MOTHER TERESA<p></p><p></p>painted on the wall to help keep count of patients and beds. Patients who needed fluids had intravenous tubes connected to various bottles. Those patients who were dying were placed near the entrance of each ward, so the sisters could better tend them. Nirmal Hriday was quiet, too, with the only sounds coming from the sisters moving about or a medical treatment being administered. At one end of the hall was a burlap curtain; behind this, the dead were kept until it was time for burial. In many cases, after a patient died, local religious groups representing the Islamic, Hindu, or Christian communities claimed the bodies in order to bury the deceased according to his or her religious beliefs.<p></p><p></p>From the day Nirmal Hriday opened, Mother Teresa kept a meticulous record of the number of cases admitted. Upon admittance, each patient’s name, age, and address were recorded; whether the patient died or was re-leased was also recorded. For those with no name or home, the entry was labeled “Unknown” with the date of admittance recorded. Over the years, with the aid of better hygiene and nutrition among the population and the construction of more hospitals and clinics tending to the poor, Nirmal Hriday saw its mortality rate drop from almost 50 percent to 10 percent.<p></p><p></p>As word of Nirmal Hriday spread, volunteers came forward to aid Mother Teresa and the Missionaries of Charity in their work. Hindu pil-grims who came to worship at the temple now made contributions to Nir-mal Hriday. A local businessman sent a delivery boy every month with a supply of Indian cigarettes known as bidis to give to the patients, and in time decided to deliver them himself. On Sundays, some of the wealthy members of Calcutta society came to Nirmal Hriday to wash and shave the patients. Other volunteers came to help clean out wounds, cut hair, or feed the patients. Still others cleaned the rooms, washing floors by hand with a mixture of water, ashes, and disinfectant. Almost all who visited left Nirmal Hriday transformed. For Mother Teresa, such experiences were necessary to understanding the plight of the poor. “Don’t just look around like a spectator,” she said to newcomers, “really look with your ears and your eyes, and you will be shown what you can do to help.”4<p></p><p></p>Mother Teresa also instituted a rule that everyone from novitiate to nun work at Nirmal Hriday. It was backbreaking work as one had to be doctor, nurse, porter, and attendant at any given time. The hours were long, usually extending far beyond the normal workday with 18-hour days a common occurrence. There was little respite, for there always was med-icine to be given, patients to be washed or fed, or prayers to be said. A sense of humor helped to counter relentless suffering and death. But few Sisters complained; more startling perhaps, many Missionaries of Charity asked to work at Nirmal Hriday.<p></p> 
KALIGHAT	7 3
<p></p>AN ONGOING MISSION<p></p><p></p>Despite all she had done, there was residual anger over Mother Teresa’s presence so near a Hindu temple. One Calcutta city council member intro-duced a motion that called for moving the home to a more suitable loca-tion. City leaders debated the issue and then agreed that, as soon as a suitable location was found for Nirmal Hriday, the facility would be moved. As most officials were happy with what Mother Teresa was doing, however, they tended to downplay complaints. And since they did not want Mother Teresa to leave, no one even proposed an alternate location for Nirmal Hri-day, which continues to operate in the same location even today.<p></p><p></p>Most patients at Nirmal Hriday fell into two categories: street cases, or people who had no family and were destitute, and family cases, where family members were unwilling or unable to care for those, especially the elderly, who were sick. In family cases, if the elderly patient recovered, the sisters made every effort to reunite the family members. Later on, those patients abandoned by their families were transferred to Prem Dan, a home established in 1975 for the elderly poor, and those ill but with a good chance of recovery. No matter the distinctions, the sisters tried never to turn anyone away who was in need.<p></p><p></p>Since it first opened in 1952, Nirmal Hriday has rescued more than 54,000 persons from the street. Of that number, half died at the home. Al-though a mortality rate of 50 percent is high, Nirmal Hriday was a home for the dying. In this respect, Mother Teresa and the Missionaries of Char-ity succeeded in their mission to provide a sanctuary for those with nowhere else to go to make their peace with God and to die with dignity. The home also emerged as one of the most potent symbols in the West for Mother Teresa and her work. As she later wrote, “In my heart, I carry the last glances of the dying. I do all I can so that they feel loved at that most important moment when a seemingly useless existence can be re-deemed.”5<p></p><p></p><p></p>EARLY CRITICS<p></p><p></p>No sooner had the criticism of Nirmal Hriday died down, then rum-blings about Mother Teresa herself surfaced. These criticisms grew throughout the decade and followed her for years. As the number of Mother Teresa’s detractors increased, the debate about her character and her attitudes toward such controversial topics as abortion and family plan-ning intensified. As donations to her order increased, Mother Teresa came under scrutiny for accepting contributions from questionable donors.<p></p> 
74	MOTHER TERESA<p></p><p></p>One of the first to question Mother Teresa’s handling of Nirmal Hriday was a young medical student named Marcus Fernandes. Before coming to Nirmal Hriday, Fernandes was already familiar with Mother Teresa and her work. His sister had attended Loreto, and through her, he had learned a great deal about the Missionaries of Charity.<p></p><p></p>As inexperienced at medicine as he was, Fernandes, nonetheless, was unhappy with the haphazard clinical practices that he found at Nirmal Hriday. He made several suggestions to Mother Teresa about how she could improve the chances for patients’ recoveries. According to Fernan-des, the biggest problem at Nirmal Hriday was not cancer, tuberculosis, or heart ailments, but malnutrition. Fernandes suggested that giving patients rice fortified with vitamin supplements would improve their chances of survival. He also suggested new approaches to diagnosis along with a sep-arate area where he could make a more thorough examination of patients. His recommendations failed to convince Mother Teresa. His widow, Pa-tricia Fernandes, remarked, “He could not persuade her to treat them with vitamins. She did not want them treated; she expected people to die and would simply say, ‘Well, she’s gone to God.’ She was not particularly in-terested in medicine.”6<p></p><p></p>Others who visited or worked at Nirmal Hriday similarly noted Mother Teresa’s seeming nonchalance over others’ deaths. One visitor recalled how, when her sisters asked Mother Teresa to try to save a 16-year-old boy from dying, she simply blessed the ailing young man and said, “Never mind, it’s a lovely day to go to Heaven.”7 A young woman volunteer, who had been thinking of joining the Missionaries of Charity, helped a young woman with a heart defect enter Nirmal Hriday. Mother Teresa told her that there was nothing more she could do, it was in God’s hands as to whether the young woman would live or die.<p></p><p></p>Dr. Fernandes stayed at Nirmal Hriday for two years, before leaving for London to complete his medical training. When he returned to India and again offered his services to Mother Teresa he saw, to his dismay, that nothing had changed at Nirmal Hriday except that some conditions had become worse. A great deal of the money that had been donated to Nir-mal Hriday was being wasted, and the facilities needed improvement. Fer-nandes was particularly angered by the sight of an X-ray machine that was now useless and rusting. When he approached Mother Teresa about it, she told him that there was no one trained to use it. Dr. Fernandes continued off and on to see Mother Teresa, but after her refusal to pay for his treat-ment of a skin ailment that had been plaguing her, he severed his associ-ation with her. He did, however, volunteer his time and services with other charity and missionary groups in Calcutta. But, when asked, he<p></p>

<p></p>never changed his assessment of Mother Teresa. To him, she was a hard and extremely ruthless woman.8<p></p><p></p>Another vocal critic of Mother Teresa was a British doctor of ophthal-mology, Major E. John Somerset, who was affiliated with the Calcutta Medical College Hospital from 1939 to 1961. During the early 1950s, when Mother Teresa and her Missionaries of Charity were first becoming known, Dr. Somerset was donating his time to five or six charitable homes for the aged and sick in Calcutta. He soon began getting regular visits from Mother Teresa, who would bring him patients she had found in need of treatment. Many of the cases Somerset treated were children who suf-fered from severe vitamin A deficiency to such a degree that their corneas were melting away. Although Somerset promised Mother Teresa that he would see as many cases as he could, he asked that she let him know be-forehand and not come when he was seeing his regular patients. But to Somerset’s dismay, Mother Teresa ignored his request and continued to bring patients to him without an appointment. He came to regard her as a nuisance and a bother.<p></p><p></p>Another volunteer, Sue Ryder, who had worked as a nurse during World War II, also had her problems with Mother Teresa. When Ryder came to India with her husband, she occasionally visited the slums with Mother Teresa. She approached Mother Teresa about merging the Mis-sionaries of Charities ventures with her own charitable foundation, but was rebuffed. The two women had other problems with each other. Ryder strongly suggested that the night staff at Nirmal Hriday be increased, as it was often overnight that patients needed the most comfort and care. However, Mother Teresa refused to consider a change in schedules: her sisters were to return to the convent at night to say their prayers. The matter was closed.<p></p><p></p><p></p>THE BRITISH, COLONIAL GUILT, AND MOTHER TERESA<p></p><p></p>Complaints about Mother Teresa did little to dampen the tremendous goodwill many felt toward her and her congregation. This was particularly true in the English Catholic community of Calcutta. Many women vol-unteered to help raise funds or provide toys, food, and clothing, especially for the children. One volunteer, an Englishwoman named Ann Blaikie, coordinated volunteer efforts and on occasion spoke to civic organizations and other groups about the Missionaries of Charity.<p></p><p></p>As Anne Sebba, one of Mother Teresa’s biographers, noted, the atti-tude of the English, especially English women, was very important in<p></p> 
76	MOTHER TERESA<p></p><p></p>Mother Teresa’s early successes. Many of these women lived in the exclu-sive areas of Calcutta, belonged to certain clubs, and socialized only with each other. Their only interaction with Bengalis came through their do-mestics or in some official capacity. Some British who spent time in India before and after its independence believe that Mother Teresa went a long way in helping them to justify the privileged life that many English living in India enjoyed. As more than one person recalled, by stepping out from their upper-class surroundings and journeying to the slums or to Nirmal Hriday or to one of the many clinics or schools Mother Teresa had estab-lished, they could, for a moment or two anyway, say that they helped Mother Teresa and eased their guilt. And Mother Teresa knew how to ma-nipulate her audiences, whether she was speaking to one person or an en-tire roomful. One man who grew up knowing Mother Teresa described how she solicited funds and supplies. According to his account, Mother Teresa fixed her gaze on the person and stated how the Missionaries of Charity really needed such and such an item, and that they did not know how they would find the money. The person often found himself rooted to the spot; almost always that person ended up pulling out the checkbook to provide Mother Teresa with whatever she wanted.9 Other English men and women who spent time in India and also helped Mother Teresa felt something much more profound. As one man explained it, when he was in India during the war, he rarely came into contact with poor people, though he realized he should have. He also believed that the British had taken far more out of India than they had contributed. In the end, the British failed in their duties to aid the poor and helpless of India.10 Helping Mother Teresa was a way to make amends.<p></p><p></p>Although this attitude may have eased many consciences, it also an-gered the people who were the supposed beneficiaries of such generosity, who resented Western condescension. For many Indians, the efforts of Westerners, and the British in particular, promoted the false impression that the people of India were indifferent to the suffering of their own. Fur-ther, these critics charged, Westerners, as symbolized by Mother Teresa and the Missionaries of Charity, appeared to be the only ones who do help the poor and infirm in India, when in fact this was not the case.<p></p><p></p>Still, there is little question that with the establishment of Nirmal Hri-day, Mother Teresa and the Missionaries of Charity gained a reputation for good works not only in Calcutta, but throughout the nation and the world. By 1955, though, Mother Teresa had other things on her mind. She turned her energies and attention to two groups who needed her help and for whom she had done nothing specific: children and lepers.<p></p>

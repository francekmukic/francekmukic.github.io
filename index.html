Chapter II<p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> I resisted all the way: a new thing for me, and a circum-stance which greatly strengthened the bad opinion Bessie and Miss Abbot were disposed to entertain of me. The fact is, I was a trifle beside myself; or rather OUT of myself, as the French would say: I was conscious that a moment’s mu-tiny had already rendered me liable to strange penalties, and, like any other rebel slave, I felt resolved, in my desper-<p></p> <p></p> ation, to go all lengths.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Hold her arms, Miss Abbot: she’s like a mad cat.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘For shame! for shame!’ cried the lady’s-maid. ‘What shocking conduct, Miss Eyre, to strike a young gentleman, your benefactress’s son! Your young master.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Master! How is he my master? Am I a servant?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘No; you are less than a servant, for you do nothing for your keep. There, sit down, and think over your wicked-ness.’<p></p> <p></p> They had got me by this time into the apartment indi-cated by Mrs. Reed, and had thrust me upon a stool: my impulse was to rise from it like a spring; their two pair of hands arrested me instantly.<p></p> <p></p> ‘If you don’t sit still, you must be tied down,’ said Bessie. ‘Miss Abbot, lend me your garters; she would break mine directly.’<p></p> <p></p> Miss Abbot turned to divest a stout leg of the necessary<p></p>

ligature. This preparation for bonds, and the additional ig-nominy it inferred, took a little of the excitement out of me.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Don’t take them off,’ I cried; ‘I will not stir.’<p></p> <p></p> In guarantee whereof, I attached myself to my seat by my hands.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Mind you don’t,’ said Bessie; and when she had ascer-tained that I was really subsiding, she loosened her hold of me; then she and Miss Abbot stood with folded arms, look-ing darkly and doubtfully on my face, as incredulous of my sanity.<p></p> <p></p> ‘She never did so before,’ at last said Bessie, turning to the Abigail.<p></p> <p></p> ‘But it was always in her,’ was the reply. ‘I’ve told Missis often my opinion about the child, and Missis agreed with me. She’s an underhand little thing: I never saw a girl of her age with so much cover.’<p></p> <p></p> Bessie answered not; but ere long, addressing me, she said—‘You ought to be aware, Miss, that you are under ob-ligations to Mrs. Reed: she keeps you: if she were to turn you off, you would have to go to the poorhouse.’<p></p> <p></p> I had nothing to say to these words: they were not new to me: my very first recollections of existence included hints of the same kind. This reproach of my dependence had become a vague sing-song in my ear: very painful and crushing, but only half intelligible. Miss Abbot joined in—<p></p> <p></p> ‘And you ought not to think yourself on an equality with the Misses Reed and Master Reed, because Missis kindly al-lows you to be brought up with them.

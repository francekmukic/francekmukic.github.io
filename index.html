<p></p>Chapter  7<p></p><p></p>SHISHU BHAVAN AND SHANTINAGAR: PLACES OF PEACE<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>By 1955, Mother Teresa turned her energies to another group in need: the children of the poor. In a relatively short time, Mother Teresa and the Missionaries of Charity had made progress in providing education for poor children with the creation of schools in the slums. But providing children with an education paled beside even bigger problem: what to do with the growing number of unwanted and abandoned children in the city.<p></p><p></p>Since India’s independence, the number of unwanted children roaming in the streets of Calcutta has increased. Orphaned, sick, and disabled chil-dren were often cast into the streets to fend for themselves. Some children tried to eke out a living by begging, others through petty crime such as stealing. Poor families, faced with the growing burden of supporting their children, abandoned them. Young girls and infants particularly were at great risk, because in Indian society boys are considered more valuable. Evidence of this cultural bias was everywhere; for the Missionaries of Charity the sight of a newborn female infant, alone and left to die, was common. For Mother Teresa, children were a special gift from God. She wrote:<p></p><p></p>Children long for somebody to accept them, to love them, to praise them, to be proud of them. Let us bring the child back to the center of our care and concern. This is the only way the world can survive because our children are the only hope for the future. As older people are called to God, only their chil-dren can take their place.1<p></p> 
80	MOTHER TERESA<p></p><p></p>Even though many Catholic charities were active in this area and Cal-cutta had a number of orphanages, the number of children on the streets were growing too quickly for these groups to manage.<p></p><p></p>SHISHU BHAVAN<p></p><p></p>To Mother Teresa, the sight of so many unloved children was heart-breaking. It was not enough to rescue as many children as possible from the streets, the gutters, the garbage heaps, and the alleyways. What was needed was a refuge where the children could be taken, nurtured, and loved. For Mother Teresa, these children were nothing less than a symbol of the Christ child. Although other charities in Calcutta did their best to deal with the problem, it was clear that they needed help. As with Nirmal Hriday, Mother Teresa had once again identified a problem that was caus-ing the city officials of Calcutta a great deal of embarrassment. As a result of her previous successes, she received recognition and cooperation from the highest offices in the city.<p></p><p></p>During one of her many forays through the city, Mother Teresa made the acquaintance of Dr. B. C. Roy, Chief Minister of West Bengal and a medical doctor. Dr. Roy often gave free consultations at his home office and Mother Teresa lined up with the rest of the poor every day at 6 A.M. More often than not, her requests were political, rather than medical. She told the doctor about the needs for water or electricity in a slum area that she had visited. Dr. Roy dutifully wrote memos to the official responsible, informing him of the problem. In time, he began to pay closer attention to the tiny nun who showed such great concern for the poor of his city. He then told her to come to his office, where he helped open the doors of var-ious city offices to her. Mother Teresa now could call on him freely; in turn, Dr. Roy trusted her completely. With his help, she began to imple-ment her latest project for the children of the poor.<p></p><p></p>And so it was on September 23, 1955, Mother Teresa opened the first Shishu Bhavan, a home for children. Located near Creek Lane, and just a short walk from the Motherhouse, the small unpainted bungalow was the first of several children’s homes established by the Missionaries of Charity. Like Nirmal Hriday, the sisters had to clean the house thoroughly to get it ready for its new occupants. Though the house was small, it opened into a spacious courtyard; Mother Teresa had rented the home from a Muslim who had left the city.<p></p><p></p>When the first Shishu Bhavan was ready, the sisters went about in search of residents. They did not have to look far; most everywhere they went, they found children in need, many of them infants, some not even<p></p> 
SHISHU BHAVAN AND SHANTINAGAR	81
<p></p>a day old. The infants were brought back to the house, cleaned, fed, and given medical treatment, as many suffered from malnutrition and tuber-culosis. Those that survived were dressed in green-and-white checked clothing, then placed in boxes, packing crates, or even on the floor. Those who were too sick were held lovingly by the sisters until they died. Like the home for the dying, Mother Teresa wanted these small in-fants and children to be cleansed, held, and loved, even though death was imminent. As crowded as the Shishu Bhavan was, Mother Teresa never turned away a child, even if it meant that infants slept three to a cot; for those fighting for their life, a box heated by a light bulb was used.<p></p><p></p>By 1958, the Missionaries of Charity had established Shishu Bhavans to care for more than 90 children. In addition, Mother Teresa accepted a government grant that provided 33 rupees for each child. But after a few months of working within the government guidelines, Mother Teresa de-cided to stop taking the grant money. She believed she could do just as well spending 17 rupees per child; this allowed her to take in more chil-dren and provide them with the care they needed.<p></p><p></p>Besides seeking out children themselves, the Missionaries of Charity also sent letters to all medical clinics and nursing homes in Calcutta, stat-ing that they would welcome any child without a home. Periodically, young pregnant women, many of whom had been cast out of their homes, would show up at a Shishu Bhavan seeking refuge. The sisters took them in, and the expectant mothers worked in the homes until they gave birth. If for some reason the new mother could not care for her child, the sisters took the child, but only as a last resort. The home also acted as an after-noon high school for young boys who would otherwise have been on the streets learning to rob and steal.<p></p><p></p>CARING FOR THE CHILDREN<p></p><p></p>As with many of her undertakings, Mother Teresa chose a practical ap-proach in overseeing the Shishu Bhavans. She firmly believed in teaching the older children a skill or giving them a practical education that would allow them to make their way in the world. Among the first things she did when opening the home was to acquire some old typewriters. She taught some of the older girls how to type with the hope that they could find sec-retarial jobs. The sisters also taught carpentry for boys and needlework for girls. Because Mother Teresa’s schools were not recognized by the govern-ment, nor would the Calcutta schools accept the children unless they paid tuition or fees, she depended on the largesse of benefactors to sponsor the<p></p> 
82	MOTHER TERESA<p></p><p></p>children. One of the first was a wealthy Hindu woman who sponsored 10 children for 10 years.<p></p><p></p>In time, other donors would do the same. This practice helped the chil-dren to receive the education or technical skills they needed to become self-supporting. It was common, for instance, for an Indian donor to pay tuition for an infant from birth to the end of the child’s school years. Over the years, the circle of donors widened considerably, as donors throughout the world sponsored children at the Shishu Bhavans. The support monies donated for the children were placed in a bank account until the child reached school age; the funds were then used to pay for the child’s edu-cation. This system proved so successful that in 1975 Mother Teresa organized the World Child Welfare Fund, which shared the financial as-sistance among all of the children under the care of the Missionaries of Charity.<p></p><p></p>THE PROMISE OF A NEW LIFE<p></p><p></p>For residents of Shishu Bhavan who were of marrying age, Mother Teresa, in accordance with Hindu custom, helped arrange marriages. Act-ing as a marriage broker, Mother Teresa worked with other Hindu families seeking a bride for a male relative. While the social status of the girls who lived at Shishu Bhavan was, in general, low, Mother Teresa made sure that each young woman had a dowry, or gifts, to present to the prospective bridegroom’s family. These dowries always included a new sari, a few trin-kets, and a wedding ring. Local benefactors also helped in many instances adding to the dowry some gold ornaments, household utensils, furniture, and in many cases, money in a small bank account opened in the future bride’s name. On any given day, the couples could be found gathering out-side the Motherhouse to greet Mother Teresa and her Missionaries of Charity. In time, a joke started to make the rounds that a prospective bridegroom had better watch his step as he was inheriting not one mother-in-law, but several.<p></p><p></p>Perhaps the most important program that Mother Teresa created for the children’s homes were adoptions. When the program began, the ma-jority of children were placed with Christian families. Slowly, many Hindu middle-class families opened their homes to unwanted and aban-doned children. Initially, boys were still preferred over girls, but, over time, many Hindu families were happy to welcome a new child, regardless of sex, into their homes. Soon, Mother Teresa began to find homes for In-dian children with overseas adoptive parents from Europe and North America. However, the majority of families wishing to adopt wanted only<p></p> 
SHISHU BHAVAN AND SHANTINAGAR	83
<p></p>healthy children. Though physically disabled children might find a home with European families, children with severe mental disabilities stayed at the Shishu Bhavan.<p></p><p></p>In emphasizing adoption, Mother Teresa was also battling abortion, which she strongly opposed. She once wrote that with abortion:<p></p><p></p>the mother kills even her own child to solve her problems. And, by abortion, the father is told he does not have to take any responsibility at all for the child he has brought into the world. That father is likely to put other women into the same trouble. So abortion leads to abortion. Any country that ac-cepts abortion is not teaching its people to love but to use vio-lence to get what they want.2<p></p><p></p>For Mother Teresa, adoption was the best way to combat not only abor-tion, but the growing practice of sterilizing women to cut down on esca-lating birth rates. The Indian government advocated female sterilization as a way to combat population growth. To combat abortion clinics, Mother Teresa and her sisters sent word to medical clinics, hospitals, and police stations that the Missionaries of Charity would accept all un-wanted children.<p></p><p></p>In addition to adoption, Mother Teresa also became involved in family planning. The Missionaries began instruction in what Mother Teresa called Holy Family Planning, which emphasized natural family planning based on the rhythm method, the only family-planning practice sanc-tioned by the Roman Catholic Church. The Missionaries also set up a number of family-planning centers where young married couples not only learned how the rhythm method worked, but also learned that abstaining from sex was another way to avoid unwanted pregnancies. Despite the simplicity of these methods, teaching them to the poor had its drawbacks. One familiar story involved a woman who had already given birth to a large number of children. Wishing to avoid another pregnancy, she re-ceived instruction in the rhythm method and was given a string of beads of various colors to help her keep track of her ovulation. Several months later, she returned to one of the family planning centers, obviously preg-nant. She told the sisters that she had hung the beads around a statue of Kali, and forgot about them. Then, she could not understand why she be-came pregnant.<p></p><p></p>As they had with her practices at Nirmal Hriday, detractors criticized Mother Teresa’s stance on abortion and sterilization. Many argued that there were too many unwanted children in India and that there was no<p></p> 
84	MOTHER TERESA<p></p><p></p>way that the Missionaries of Charity could possibly care for every single one. Although abortion clinics were available, they were rare and costly, hardly justifying Mother Teresa’s outrage. Outlawing abortions might cause women to try to abort their unborn child themselves, often with ter-rible and fatal results. In the face of such criticism, Mother Teresa stood her ground and never veered away from the Church’s teachings on birth control and abortion. But the controversy was far from over; in the years to come, Mother Teresa would be a visible target for pro-choice advocates the world over.<p></p><p></p>REACHING OUT IN OTHER WAYS<p></p><p></p>Besides organizing the children’s homes, Mother Teresa reached out to the poor in other ways. In 1956, she organized her first mobile clinic to help those who could not get to one of the free clinics. She was aided by Catholic Relief Services in New York City, which donated $5,000 to transform an old van into a traveling medical dispensary that visited the slums throughout the city offering free medical services. With the help of some doctors, a small laboratory was set up in Shishu Bhavan to do med-ical testing.<p></p><p></p>The Shishu Bhavan also became a buzzing center of activity for feeding the poor. In the home’s small kitchen, the sisters cooked as much rice as they could, which they handed out along with bananas. On any given af-ternoon, there were anywhere from 50 to 100 women with children wait-ing to receive food. For many, this was the only meal of the day.<p></p><p></p>There were some hazards in providing the free food. On one occasion, the sisters had nothing to give out for that day, for the agency that sup-plied them had stopped sending food to the home. The hungry crowd grew angrier and angrier; some even tried to set fire to the home. At one point Mother Teresa pushed back with surprising strength a whole line of women who rushed forward to receive their food. It was only because of the arrival of the police and fire brigade that the incident did not esca-late into something more serious. On another, less dangerous occasion, the kitchen ran out of plates and the sisters used dinner plates from the Motherhouse to give to the poor.<p></p><p></p>TENDING TO THE UNCLEAN<p></p> 
<p></p>Mother Teresa introduced the mobile dispensary in 1956 in response to another growing problem on the Calcutta streets: lepers. Earlier, the Gobra hospital, which housed many of the city’s leprosy cases, had closed,<p></p> 
SHISHU BHAVAN AND SHANTINAGAR	85
<p></p>leaving thousands of patients with no place to go. Mother Teresa had lob-bied hard against the closing, but growing pressure from local residents and developers, who wanted the hospital moved away from the area, forced the city to shut down the facility. A new hospital for lepers was soon built further outside the city limits.<p></p><p></p>Mother Teresa, realizing that it would be difficult for the former pa-tients of Gobra to go to the new facility, decided to open up her own clinic. Like the former Gobra facility, she found a site that was centrally located, which would make it easier for patients to receive treatment. However, residents in the neighborhood, upon learning of the proposed clinic, did their best to stop her efforts. On one occasion, when she ar-rived in the neighborhood to inspect the site, she was met by angry neighborhood residents who began throwing stones at her. She took the angry response in stride and remarked that it appeared that God did not want the clinic in this area. She would pray for guidance.<p></p><p></p>As if in answer to her prayers, some American benefactors donated an ambulance to the Missionaries of Charity. Mother Teresa hoped the vehi-cle would be the first of many mobile leprosy clinics. More help came from a Dr. Sen, a physician and specialist in the treatment of skin disease and leprosy. Sen had recently retired from the Carmichael Hospital for Tropi-cal Diseases. Unsure of what to do with his free time and having heard of the works of the Missionaries of Charity, he offered his services. Mother Teresa gratefully accepted. Assisting Dr. Sen were three sisters who had received nurse’s training.<p></p><p></p>In September 1957, the first mobile leprosy clinic was launched. The ambulance could hold six persons along with a generous supply of medi-cine, food, and medical records. Traveling from slum to slum, and also making a stop outside the walls of the Loreto convent, the Missionaries of Charity sought out the city’s lepers. In time, eight treatment stations were established throughout Calcutta offering hope to the city’s 30,000 persons afflicted by leprosy. The bright blue vehicle soon became a recognized symbol of help and comfort. At each stop, the sisters handed out vitamins and medicine, along with packets of food. By January 1958, over 600 lep-ers regularly sought treatment from the mobile clinic.<p></p><p></p>A HIDEOUS DISEASE<p></p><p></p>In trying to help those afflicted by leprosy, Mother Teresa faced a spe-cial kind of problem. The disease, also known as Hansen’s disease, has been documented since biblical times. It is a particularly insidious ail-ment, striking people with little warning. The bacterium that causes lep-<p></p> 
86	MOTHER TERESA<p></p><p></p>rosy attacks the nervous system and destroys the body’s ability to feel pain. Without pain, people injured themselves without always knowing it. In-juries become infected and resulted in tissue loss. Fingers and toes become shortened and deformed as the cartilage is absorbed into the body.<p></p><p></p>Early symptoms include discolored or light patches on the skin accom-panied by loss of feeling. When the nerves are affected, small muscles be-come paralyzed, which leads to the curling of the fingers and thumb. When leprosy attacks nerves in the legs, there is no sensation in the feet. The feet can become subject to erosion through untended wounds and in-fection. If the facial nerves are affected, a person loses the blinking reflex of the eye, which can eventually lead to dryness, ulceration, and blind-ness. Bacilli entering the mucous lining of the nose can lead to internal damage and scarring, which in time causes the nose to collapse. The dis-ease is assisted in its spread by unsanitary conditions, coughing, and sneez-ing. In a small household with poor sanitation, it is easy for the entire family to become infected.<p></p><p></p>The disease also carried with it, in India and elsewhere, a deep social stigma. The fear of becoming contaminated often prompts lepers to be banished. After the Gobra hospital closed, there was no place for many of the lepers in Calcutta to go except the slums and the countryside, where many died neglected. Even when a person recovered from the disease, they were still shunned by the community and often could not find hous-ing, work, or help—the social stigma of the disease was that prevalent.<p></p><p></p>Although leprosy had all but disappeared in Europe and North Amer-ica by the sixteenth century, it still existed in Asia, Africa, South Amer-ica, and the Middle East. In 1873 Dr. Armauer Hansen of Norway discovered the bacteria that causes the disease, and a cure was almost a century away. During the 1950s, when Mother Teresa opened her first mo-bile clinics, leprosy was treated with dapsone pills. However, the leprosy bacilli began developing dapsone resistance hindering successful treat-ment.<p></p><p></p>TITLAGARH<p></p><p></p>For those stricken with leprosy, there was one place outside of Calcutta to go—Titlagarh, an industrial suburb located about an hour’s drive from Calcutta. Near the railway lines, a cluster of shanties had sprung up on ei-ther side. It was a village of the poor, with the lepers occupying the hov-els alongside a swamp. The area was a human cesspool: there was no drainage or sewage, no drinking water, and no electricity. Even the wretchedly poor had nothing to do with the lepers. Townspeople and the<p></p> 
SHISHU BHAVAN AND SHANTINAGAR	87
<p></p>police also stayed away for fear of infection. As a result, crime was ram-pant and indiscriminate; violence and murder were everyday happenings. The lepers, because of their disease and poverty, could not seek out treat-ment; no doctor, clinic, or hospital in Titlagarh would see them.<p></p><p></p>In the meantime, even with the success of the mobile clinic, Mother Teresa and her sisters realized that there were still a number of patients from Titlagarh who could not afford the bus or train fare every week to seek help. Those who could often found themselves banned from riding. In addition, Mother Teresa and the sisters were seeing more cases of new-borns afflicted with leprosy; and it was a burden for mothers to come to the clinics. Many patients asked Mother Teresa to open a permanent clinic for them nearer to home.<p></p><p></p>When she made her first visit to Titlagarh, Mother Teresa realized that something needed to be done. Within a few months, she had established a small clinic in a shed near the railway lines. A few sisters were sent to handle the enormous caseload for the Titlagarh clinic. But it soon became evident that more needed to be done.<p></p><p></p>To draw attention to the plight of the lepers, Mother Teresa turned once again to her lay volunteers and benefactors. Many groups, hearing of the living conditions of the lepers, banded together to support a citywide collection to help them. The symbol used for the collection drive was a bell, the ancient symbol of the so-called unclean, but now pressed into service as a symbol of compassion. The slogan of the collection drive was Touch the Leper with Your Compassion; and the saying was carried on posters, signs, newspapers, and on the mobile van, too. The citywide cam-paign made it possible for even more lepers to be treated by uncovering other areas where groups of lepers resided.<p></p><p></p>Finally work was begun on the construction of a more permanent building. But that project ran into early difficulties. The first attempts to improve the living conditions of the railway site were met with opposi-tion from gang leaders who ran most of the illegal activities in the area. Stones greeted the volunteers who were cleaning up the site, but they persisted. Construction of two small cottages at last began, and with them, resistance to the construction faded. The gang leaders fled and many of the residents pitched in to help with the building. In addition to the clinic, which opened in March 1959, the facility housed a rehabilita-tion center, a hospital, and a cafeteria. An assortment of utility buildings was added during a 10-year period. By the time construction was finished in 1968, the buildings constituted a mile-long stretch. Mother Teresa asked the municipality of Titlagarh for water, sewers, and electricity for the area. Children were put into local schools, and slowly small shops<p></p> 
88	MOTHER TERESA<p></p><p></p>and stalls appeared in the area where once only crime and violence had flourished.<p></p><p></p>But no sooner had the clinic opened than the municipal leaders feared an influx of lepers would come to Titlagarh. They begged Mother Teresa to consider opening yet another facility for lepers. With that in mind, Mother Teresa turned to her next project: Shantinagar.<p></p><p></p>SHANTINAGAR<p></p><p></p>In 1961, Mother Teresa received a gift from the Indian government: 34 acres of land located about 200 miles from Calcutta. She would pay the government an annual fee of one rupee a year for the land. The land was uncultivated, almost a jungle in appearance. With funds raised by Ger-man children singing at a charity concert, Mother Teresa began construc-tion of Shantinagar—The Place of Peace for Lepers.<p></p><p></p>There was not enough money to complete the project. Hoping for a miracle, the Missionaries of Charity prayed for guidance. Their prayers were answered in 1965 in the form of a white 1964 Lincoln Continental automobile. The car was originally a present from American Catholics to Pope Paul VI. The pope had the car specially flown in for his state visit to India in 1964. While there, he visited Mother Teresa and the home at Nirmal Hriday and was so touched by the work of the Missionaries of Charity that he gave the car to Mother Teresa before he left. Having no practical use for the car, Mother Teresa raffled it off, raising a much larger sum of money than she would have by simple selling the automobile. In the end, the raffle netted the order of approximately 460,000 rupees or $100,000. With the funds raised by the raffle, Mother Teresa could pay for the main hospital block at Shantinagar.<p></p><p></p>In 1968, Mother Teresa sent Sister Francis Xavier along with several other sisters to Shantinagar to oversee the construction and maintenance of the grounds. Within the next two years, a number of key buildings went up including a rehabilitation center and cottage for lepers built by the pa-tients themselves. In addition, flowering trees and shrubs, fruit trees, and vegetable gardens were planted on the grounds. The nearby pond was stocked with fish, all with an eye to promoting self-sufficiency among the residents.<p></p><p></p>In time, the home for lepers offered treatment and a chance at a nor-mal life for almost 400 lepers and their families. New arrivals were taught to make bricks in order to construct new homes for future patients. The residents tended their own cattle, grew their own rice and wheat, and tilled their own gardens. Others ran a grocer’s shop. Some residents made<p></p> 
SHISHU BHAVAN AND SHANTINAGAR	89
<p></p>baskets, which are used in the nearby coal mines. There is even a printing press. Shantinagar also has its own local government with its leaders elected from among the residents. Medical treatment is not far away, and with the advent of better drugs since the 1970s, many lepers had a chance to recover from their illness. There is also a Shishu Bhavan on the prem-ises, where children can live and be protected from the more infectious patients.<p></p><p></p>With each new success and each new undertaking, it was becoming clear that Mother Teresa possessed extraordinary vision. She was making a name for herself, not only throughout Calcutta, but in India and be-yond. Her great determination to help those who could not help them-selves had earned her a host of supporters and a growing number of critics. As the size and scale of the Missionaries of Charity grew, so did the seeds of controversy. By the end of the 1950s, it was clear that Mother Teresa and her order would no longer toil in anonymity.<p></p><p></p>NOTES<p></p><p></p>Mother Teresa with Jaya Chaliha and Edward Le Joly, The Joy in Loving: A Guide to Daily Living (New York: Viking, 1996), p. 327.<p></p><p></p>Mother Teresa with Chaliha and Le Joly, Joy, p. 371.<p></p>

<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Chapter  8<p></p><p></p>THE GROWTH OF A MIRACLE<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>By the late 1950s, Mother Teresa found herself becoming quite newsworthy, at least in Calcutta, where she was the subject of several articles in both the Indian and English newspapers. This attention marked the beginning of a remarkable relationship between Mother Teresa and the Indian press. For one thing, the articles about Mother Teresa and the Missionaries of Charity often resulted in donations to the order. Some of the gifts came in the form of money; others donated supplies and their time.<p></p><p></p>The wife of a British businessman and a former Loreto student, Aruna Paul, helped teach children in the slums. She also organized Christmas parties for the children. After her own children were born, she made a point of having birthday parties for the children in Shishu Bhavan on the same day as her own children’s celebrations. She also made a point of tak-ing her children with her to Shishu Bhavan to impress upon them how fortunate they were. Paul also had access to a textile factory; through her efforts, the sisters received new saris every year. Years later, Paul recalled that Mother Teresa, prior to her traveling, never seemed hurried and that she always had time for everyone who came to see her. But that would all soon change as Mother Teresa began capturing the attention of a much wider audience, while recognizing there were other places in the world that might benefit from her vision.<p></p><p></p>SETTING FOOT ON THE WORLD STAGE<p></p> 
<p></p>For nearly 10 years, the work done by the Missionaries of Charity had been confined to Calcutta. This was in agreement with church law, which<p></p> 
92	MOTHER TERESA<p></p><p></p>prohibited new orders to open houses outside of the diocese. Initially, Mother Teresa realized that between the archbishop’s emphatic enforce-ment of this rule, and the horrific problems she faced in Calcutta, expan-sion of any kind was clearly out of the question.<p></p><p></p>But, in 1959, things had changed. There was one year left before the probationary period of the Missionaries of Charity formally ended, and the sisters were eager to take their mission outside of Calcutta and begin work in other parts of India. When Mother Teresa went to Archbishop Périer, he relented. But he told Mother Teresa that her work could only expand into other areas of the country, not beyond. She agreed. New houses of the Missionaries of Charity were established—and warmly wel-comed by church and city officials—in Delhi and Jhansi. The news of their work reached the highest echelons of Indian government; at the dedication of a children’s home in Delhi, the Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, was in attendance. When introduced to him, Mother Teresa proceeded to tell the prime minister of her order. Gently stopping her, Nehru replied that he did not need to hear of her work; he knew all about it and that was why he had come to the ceremony. The Missionar-ies of Charity also sent a group of nuns to Ranchi, a city located in the ex-tremely poor state of Bihar. Here, many girls from the local tribes were recruited to become Missionaries of Charity with great success.<p></p><p></p>In Bombay, a city with numerous Catholic churches and schools, the Missionaries of Charity were welcomed by none other than the head of the Roman Catholic Church in Bombay, Cardinal Valerian Gracias. After a short tour of the city, Mother Teresa angered many of the residents with her comment that the slums of Bombay were worse than those in Calcutta. But many others recognized that beside the many palatial homes found in the city were also tall buildings with little ventilation, no indoor plumbing, and very little fresh air. With Cardinal Gracias’s bless-ing, Mother Teresa soon opened a home for the dying, similar to Nirmal Hriday.<p></p><p></p>In the autumn of 1960, Mother Teresa looked beyond the borders of her adopted country and accepted an invitation to speak at the National Council for Catholic Women to be held in Las Vegas, Nevada. Although it seemed an unlikely destination for a woman considered a saint through-out India, Mother Teresa went with the hope of raising more funds for the Missionaries of Charity.<p></p><p></p>By this time, Mother Teresa was 50 years old and in charge of 119 nuns, all but three of whom were Indian, and she wished to carry her message further. As it turned out, her reputation was already becoming established on the world stage. In the United States, she had appeared on the front<p></p> 
THE GROWTH OF A MIRACLE	93
<p></p>page of an American magazine called Jubilee: A Magazine for the Church and Her People in 1958, which introduced her at least to the American Catholic community.<p></p><p></p>That October, Mother Teresa arrived in Los Angeles; from there she traveled to Las Vegas in the company of a former volunteer with the Mis-sionaries of Charity, Katherine Bracken. Mother Teresa was to give a speech entitled “These Works of Love,” in which she outlined the work of the Missionaries of Charity.<p></p><p></p>Mother Teresa had never spoken in public before; previously she had relied on others to do her talking for her. But speaking before 3,000 women, she discovered that what might have been a disadvantage actu-ally was an advantage. Instead of a professional giving a polished speech, Mother Teresa showed herself to be a natural orator. She spoke easily of her life’s work and that of the Missionaries of Charity in India. She stated she was not there to beg for donations; instead she continued to rely on God’s providence for help. But she did remind her audience that they, too, could participate in doing something beautiful for God. As she was to dis-cover, this approach proved far more effective in raising money than a di-rect appeal ever would. Afterwards, sitting in a booth in the convention hall, she watched as person after person stopped to put cash in a bag she carried with her. During the course of the day, the bag was emptied several times. Mother Teresa had discovered a powerful and successful way in which to raise funds for her projects. It was a formula from which she rarely deviated in the following years.<p></p><p></p>During her time in Las Vegas, Mother Teresa was less interested in the goings-on in the nearby casinos and nightclubs than she was to traveling in the desert. When asked what she thought of the city, she replied that the neon lights of the city’s casinos and hotels reminded her of Dewali, the yearly Hindu festival of lights. As a souvenir of her visit to Nevada, she took some long cactus spines that she found in the desert. These were later twisted into a crown of thorns and placed on the head of the cruci-fied Christ hanging behind the altar in the novitiate chapel of the Mis-sionaries of Charity in Calcutta.<p></p><p></p>A WHIRLWIND TOUR<p></p><p></p>From Las Vegas, Mother Teresa went to Peoria, Illinois, where she spoke to yet another group of Catholic women. Then it was on to Chicago and New York City. In each city, she was welcomed warmly and had little trouble in gathering more monies for the Missionaries of Charity. One disappointment in her itinerary came when a planned meeting with the<p></p> 
94	MOTHER TERESA<p></p><p></p>Democratic presidential candidate, John F. Kennedy, who was also Roman Catholic, did not take place. However, while in New York City, Mother Teresa met with Mother Anna Dengel, the Austrian-born founder of the Medical Mission Sisters, who had given Mother Teresa her early medical training in Patna a little more than a decade earlier. She also paid visits to Catholic Relief Services, and met with Bishop Fulton J. Sheen, who was a prominent radio and television personality in the United States. Sheen was the head of the American division of the foreign mission’s organi-zation, the Propagation of the Faith, which channeled donations to Cath-olic missions all over the world. But perhaps one of the most important contacts Mother Teresa made during this trip was with Marcolino Can-dau, director of the World Health Organization (WHO). She told Can-dau of her urgent need to provide for the lepers and their children in India. Candau told her that if she made her request through the Indian government, WHO would see that she received the necessary medical supplies.<p></p><p></p>From New York, Mother Teresa’s next stop was London, where she spent one evening at the home of the sister of Indian Prime Minister Nehru, who encouraged her to expand her work, particularly where vol-unteers were concerned. Mother Teresa also met with a representative of the Oxfam aid agency and had her first television interview with a British journalist on the BBC.<p></p><p></p>Her next stop was Germany, where Mother Teresa enjoyed a greater reputation, having been featured in a news magazine Weltelend (World Misery), published by the German Catholic relief agency Miseror. The ar-ticle had also shown photos of the terrible poverty in Calcutta as well as shots of Nirmal Hriday. Another news magazine Erdkreis (Earth Circle) had featured photos of Kalighat. As she stepped off the plane, wrapped in a rough wool blanket to protect her from the cold weather, Mother Teresa was greeted by a horde of German photographers and journalists.<p></p><p></p>In meeting with Miseror representatives, Mother Teresa outlined her plans for the construction of a new home for the dying in Delhi. She al-ready had land set aside, but needed help in building the proposed facility. The organization, while generally preferring to fund self-help projects, readily agreed to her request. In return, they asked only that the Mission-aries of Charity send financial statements to the organization to monitor how the money was spent. To their great surprise, Mother Teresa flatly re-jected their request, stating that the sisters did not have time to spend on preparing complicated financial forms. She assured the officials that they should not worry about the money; each penny would go to the proposed project. But her refusal to keep detailed accounts marked the beginning of<p></p> 
THE GROWTH OF A MIRACLE	95
<p></p>a practice that would continue and later become a source of much criti-cism. As Mother Teresa later argued, making out separate reports to each sponsor would be so time-consuming that the poor would suffer. Although she and her sisters recorded each donation with a letter, they did not keep detailed financial records of donations accepted and monies spent. As was her nature, Mother Teresa ignored complaints about the order’s account-ing practices.<p></p><p></p>Before leaving Germany, Mother Teresa also stopped to visit Dachau, one of the most infamous concentration camps in Nazi Germany, where more than 28,000 Jews died between 1933 and 1945. After listening to the history of the camp, Mother Teresa stated that the camp was to his-tory what the Colosseum in Rome was to the Romans who threw the Christians to their death. In Mother Teresa’s eyes, modern humans were behaving no better, and if anything, far worse.<p></p><p></p>After a brief visit to Switzerland, Mother Teresa stopped in Rome where she hoped to make a formal and personal plea to Pope John XXIII for the Missionaries of Charity to become a Society of Pontifical Right. If the pope agreed, it would mean that the Missionaries of Charity could begin working in other countries. However, when it came time to meet the pope, Mother Teresa, frightened at making the request directly to the pope, instead only asked for his blessing. She then made her request to Cardinal Gregory Agagianian, who agreed to take the matter under con-sideration. But it was clear that the Church recognized the value and im-portance of Mother Teresa not only to its missionary and humanitarian efforts, but to its efforts to spread the Gospel.<p></p><p></p>A BRIEF REUNION<p></p><p></p>While in Rome, Mother Teresa arranged a reunion with her brother Lazar, whom she had not seen in more than 30 years. Lazar now lived in Palermo, Sicily, where he worked for a pharmaceutical firm. He was also married to an Italian woman and was the father of a 10-year-old daughter. During World War II, he had joined the Italian army after the Italian oc-cupation of Albania. His defection to the Italian army earned him a death sentence in Albania; Lazar could never return to the land of his birth.<p></p><p></p>When the two met, they discussed the terrible predicament of Aga and their mother, who were still in Albania. The country, now a communist satellite of the Soviet Union, had made it virtually impossible for its resi-dents to leave Albania. Mother Teresa had applied for a visa to visit the country, and possibly because of her brother, but more likely because of her own activities, she had been refused. Albania’s atheist government<p></p> 
96	MOTHER TERESA<p></p><p></p>did not look kindly on a religious figure, particularly one becoming inter-nationally renowned.<p></p><p></p>And then all too soon, it was time to return home. Upon her arrival in Calcutta, Mother Teresa continued to work with her sisters, opening up new homes throughout India. For the next five years, new chapters ap-peared in cities and states throughout the country. Adopting the pattern established in Calcutta, the Missionaries of Charity assessed the needs of an area and adapted their programs. With each new house, each new school, each new mobile clinic, Mother Teresa’s name and works gained greater and greater recognition. Still, it was not enough, and Mother Teresa waited anxiously for news from the Vatican.<p></p><p></p>THE BIGGEST MIRACLE OF ALL<p></p><p></p>In February 1965, Mother Teresa finally received her answer: the Mis-sionaries of Charity had received the pope’s permission to become a So-ciety of Pontifical Right. In his decree granting the right, Pope Paul VI, who had succeeded John XXIII, charged Mother Teresa and her order to continue carrying out their works of charity and to dedicate themselves to God. Now, Mother Teresa could carry her good works outside of India for the first time. In time, these works included clinics for those suffering from tuberculosis; antenatal clinics; clinics for general medical needs; mobile leprosy clinics; night shelters for the homeless; homes for chil-dren, the poor, and the dying; nursery schools, primary, and secondary schools; feeding programs; villages for lepers; commercial schools; voca-tional training in carpentry, metal work, embroidery and other skills; child-care and home-management classes; and aid in the event of emer-gencies and disasters such as floods, earthquakes, famine, epidemics, riot-ing and war.<p></p><p></p>Mother Teresa’s first invitation came in 1965 when she was asked to open a house in Venezuela, to help many of the impoverished people who had lapsed in their Catholicism due to a lack of priests and nuns to sustain them. Archbishop James Robert Knox, the Internuncio to New Delhi, had already met with a South American bishop who impressed upon Knox the need for the Missionaries of Charity. Knox wanted Mother Teresa to accept the invitation and pressed her to do so. But Mother Teresa balked. She was not sure that her sisters were ready for such an un-dertaking. She wanted more time. Archbishop Knox told her that the needs of the Church were more important than the needs of her sisters. The matter was then settled. Mother Teresa and her order were going to Venezuela.<p></p> 
THE GROWTH OF A MIRACLE	97
<p></p>In July 1965, the Missionaries of Charity opened their first home out-side India in Cocorote, Venezuela. Mother Teresa, accompanied by five sisters, came to the small town. Working in Cocorote also presented the Missionaries of Charity with a very different situation. Not only were they dealing with a different language, but also with a different culture. While in Cocorote, the sisters, for the first time, began cooperating in religious education. Because priests were in such short supply, the sisters took on the duties of preparing children to receive their First Communion and Confirmation, which were important Catholic rituals for children be-tween the ages of 8 and 12.<p></p><p></p>By 1970, the duties of the sisters had expanded even more. After open-ing a house in Caracas, they received permission for three of their nuns to administer Holy Communion, a duty previously reserved for priests. This relaxing of rules allowed the Missionaries of Charity to offer Holy Com-munion to the sick and the dying. In addition, the sisters were busy con-ducting funerals, washing and cleaning for the elderly, and feeding the hungry. In 1972, the Missionaries of Charity helped with roof repairs when strong winds damaged several homes, leaving many without ade-quate shelter. In return for their many labors, the nuns might be rewarded with something simple: an egg from someone’s hen, or a banana. The sis-ters accepted the gifts with gratitude.<p></p><p></p>AN APPEAL FROM ROME<p></p><p></p>In 1968, Mother Teresa received another invitation, this time to work among the poor in Rome. The invitation came as a bit of a surprise. Rome already had more than 22,000 nuns belonging to 1,200 separate religious orders. Why, Mother Teresa thought, would the Church need yet another group to work with the poor? But this invitation was different; it came from none other than Paul VI himself.<p></p><p></p>Three years earlier, in July 1965, Mother Teresa was among a group of 40 persons granted an audience with the pope. Although Mother Teresa was overwhelmed at meeting the pope, as were the six other Missionaries of Charity who accompanied her, it appears Paul VI was taken with her. Asking for her prayers, he told Mother Teresa to write to him. Now, the pope was asking her directly for her help in working with Rome’s poor.<p></p><p></p>That August, Mother Teresa and a handful of her nuns arrived in Rome to begin work. The area in which they were to work, known as the bor-gate, is located on the outskirts of Rome. Here live the city’s poorest resi-dents, many of whom could not even begin to pay the city’s high rents. The area was home to thousands of immigrants from Sicily and Sardinia.<p></p> 
98	MOTHER TERESA<p></p><p></p>Rome’s slums were also known for their distinctive architecture. Shelters known as barraca, a kind of barracks-like structure, sprawled for acres in the city’s slums. The homes were also distinguished by their bright orange terra-cotta roofs, which were secured by heavy stones. Many of these homes lacked electricity, water, and sewage, though some enterprising souls were able to tap into the city’s electrical power source to light their homes. Some families also planted small gardens near their homes, which, in addition to supplementing their diets, alleviated the barren and harsh landscape of poverty with a wondrous riot of color.<p></p><p></p>Initial attempts to find a house for the order were futile; there appeared to be nothing for them. Finally, Mother Teresa found a barracche. It was by far the poorest and shabbiest residence that the sisters had resided in, something that appealed to Mother Teresa a great deal. With the excep-tion of the house being wired for electricity, the residence was from all ap-pearances no different from the others. There was no plumbing; the nuns would have to make do with the nearby fountain from which residents drew their water. In time, the Missionaries of Charity instituted many of the same programs for the poor of Rome that they provided elsewhere.<p></p><p></p>A GROWING MISSION<p></p><p></p>Over the next several years, Mother Teresa and her Missionaries of Charity continued to open new homes around the world. In 1967, the order opened its first home in Sri Lanka. In September 1968, a month after traveling to Rome, Mother Teresa journeyed to Tabora, Tanzania, where the sisters opened their first mission in Africa. A year later, the Missionaries of Charity were in Australia, where they opened up a center for the Aborigines. From this point on and well into the next decade, a new mission center opened somewhere in the world approximately every six months.<p></p><p></p>The Missionaries of Charity were growing in other ways, too. By 1963, Mother Teresa realized that men were better suited for certain kinds of work, such as working with young boys, than her nuns were. After con-sulting with Father Van Exem, she petitioned the archbishop of Calcutta for his permission to create a new branch of the order: the Missionary Brothers of Charity. The archbishop did not have to think very long; al-most immediately he agreed to the request.<p></p><p></p>But there were issues to settle before the new order could get underway. Men were reluctant to join because the order was still unrecognized. To become recognized meant that the order needed to grow and have the proper leadership to provide guidance and direction. Even though the<p></p> 
THE GROWTH OF A MIRACLE	99
<p></p>brothers were aligned with the Missionaries of Charity, under Church law Mother Teresa could not head a male congregation. She tried to engage the services of two other priests, but for a number of reasons could not convince either man to leave his order to take charge of the new congre-gation. Finally, a young priest applied for the position; Mother Teresa, even though she did not know him personally, agreed to have him take on the responsibility of directing the new order.<p></p><p></p>In 1966, an Australian Jesuit, Father Ian Travers-Ball, became the head of the Missionary Brothers, changing his name to Brother Andrew. Travers-Ball was a young and charismatic presence within the order. He was familiar with conditions in India having come to the country in 1954 as a new priest. He was interested in working with the poor, and specifi-cally with Mother Teresa and the Missionaries of Charity.<p></p><p></p>Early on, Brother Andrew believed it was necessary for the Brothers of Charity to establish their own presence and identity. Although he ad-mired Mother Teresa, Travers-Ball also wished to escape her domination. To establish a base for the Brothers, Brother Andrew rented a small house in Kidderpore, which Mother Teresa purchased. Along with a dozen young homeless boys, Brother Andrew moved into the home. In time, the house settled into a routine that was far different from the goings-on at Motherhouse.<p></p><p></p>In general, the Brothers adopted a style of working with the poor that was far less regimented. They were less sheltered than the Sisters, which allowed them access to the poor community in ways that the Sisters did not enjoy. The more informal approach enabled the Brothers to be more adaptable to cultural and regional differences than the Sisters. And be-cause their focus was on helping poor boys, their homes tended to be smaller and more close-knit.<p></p><p></p>One of the first places the Brothers began work was at the Howrah rail-way station where many young poor boys lived. Much as Mother Teresa did when she began working among the poor, the Brothers started out by establishing contact and helping the boys in small ways, such as passing out bars of soap or helping get medical treatment for those in need. Grad-ually, the Brothers organized an evening meal for the boys at the station. Some boys were taken in and given refuge where they could receive voca-tional training. Along with boys residing at the Shishu Bhavan, several were then transferred to other houses in and around the city, such as Nabo Jeevan (New Life), or Dum-Dum where there was a radio-repair work-shop. Boys suffering from medical or mental handicaps were taken to Nur-pur, a farm located about 20 miles outside of Calcutta, where they learned to farm. The Brothers also became heavily involved with mobile leprosy<p></p> 
100	MOTHER TERESA<p></p><p></p>clinics and, in time, would take over the day-to-day work at the leprosy colony in Titlagarh.<p></p><p></p>Like Mother Teresa’s own Missionaries of Charity, the Brothers grew rapidly. Within a decade of their creation, Brother Andrew opened up the first overseas house in war-torn Vietnam. From there, the order began opening houses all over the world, usually in places where the Missionar-ies of Charity did not have a presence. In 1975, the Brothers opened a house in a poor, crime-infested neighborhood in Los Angeles, California, where they began working with drug addicts and alcoholics who had been living on the street.<p></p><p></p>There was no shortage of rough neighborhoods in the world, and Brother Andrew sought out as many as he could find, establishing homes in Hong Kong, Japan, Taiwan, Korea, Guatemala, the Philippines, El Sal-vador, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Brazil. Everywhere they went, the Brothers undertook the jobs they knew best. Their mission, more than that of the Missionaries of Charity, brought them into contact with the residents of many a city’s mean streets and society’s outcasts: the crimi-nals, the drug addicts, and the hopeless alcoholics. The Brothers also con-tinued their work with orphaned and wayward boys. Wherever they went, they established soup kitchens and helped those in need to receive medi-cal attention.<p></p><p></p>Still, the Brothers’ road to success was not without its bumps. Pre-dictably, Brother Andrew and Mother Teresa clashed over the order’s management. One issue was dress; Brother Andrew requested that the brothers wear no uniform and instead dress in jeans and T-shirts. While this made them more accessible, it also made them at times harder to dis-tinguish, and on more than one occasion, a brother was picked up along with those he was helping to spend a night at the city jail. Mother Teresa wished for the Brothers to wear their clerical garb. She also did not agree with Brother Andrew’s willingness to delegate authority and wished for tighter, stricter management, much as she did with her own order. The final straw came when Mother Teresa established a contemplative branch of the Brothers without consulting Brother Andrew. Her actions caused a temporary rift between the two orders; in 1987, Brother Andrew left the order. His replacement, Brother Geoff, brought with him a management style and an attitude that was more complementary to Mother Teresa’s vi-sion for the Missionaries of Charity Brothers.<p></p><p></p>COME AND SEES AND CO-WORKERS<p></p> 
<p></p>Assisting the Missionaries of Charity and the Brothers were volunteers whom Brother Andrew called Come and Sees. This group consisted<p></p> 
THE GROWTH OF A MIRACLE	101
<p></p>mainly of young people interested in working with the Brothers for a few weeks or months. Some were interested in joining the order, but wanted to see if they were capable of handling the work. Mother Teresa had adopted a similar practice with her own missions for young women who might be interested in joining her order.<p></p><p></p>Also assisting Mother Teresa and her Missionaries of Charity were hundreds of volunteers, called Co-Workers. The term was borrowed from Mahatma Ghandi, who referred to his helpers by the same name. Like Ghandi, Mother Teresa’s Co-Workers were men, women, and children from all over the world. They came from a variety of backgrounds and rep-resented a number of different religions. All shared an interest in helping the poor.<p></p><p></p>Among the first Co-Workers helping Mother Teresa were the Gomes family, and the many doctors, nurses, and dentists who donated free med-ical services. By the 1950s, a more formal organization of Co-Workers had been established, largely through the efforts of British wives who were in-volved with various social services in Calcutta. When a number of these women returned to England, they began meeting, and by 1960, a Mother Teresa committee was formed that began working with the poor in En-glish cities. By the 1990s, approximately 30,000 Co-Workers were volun-teering in the United Kingdom.<p></p><p></p>Smaller groups of Co-Workers appeared in other countries as well. In the United States, there are approximately 10,000. In Europe, the num-bers are much smaller, with only a few hundred active volunteers. Still, the rise of one group has often led to the formation of another. Although forbidden to engage in fund-raising or publicity, the group publishes Co-Workers Newsletter, which goes out to all members. There is no paid of-fice or staff to put out the newsletter; all work is donated. Further, Mother Teresa stipulated that all collection centers for clothing or food are to be in someone’s residence; there is to be no rental of a unit or store-front.<p></p><p></p>In some areas, Co-Workers handled donations of money which were turned over to the Missionaries or were spent to buy bulk purchases of ne-cessities such as food, clothing, and medical supplies. The size of some of these donations are staggering even by today’s standards: for instance, in 1990, 17,000,000 Belgian francs ($680,000 in 2004 dollars) were used to purchase powdered milk, while 200,000 Dutch guilders ($146,000 in 2004 dollars) bought protein biscuits. Both purchases were then sent to Mis-sionaries of Charity houses in Africa, South and Central America, and Asia. An additional 3,000,000 Belgian francs ($120,000 in 2004 dollars) was spent to buy clothes bought at one-tenth of retail value and sent to various countries in Africa. Finally, 24 large containers of used clothing,<p></p> 
102	MOTHER TERESA<p></p><p></p>blankets, and bandages that were collected door-to-door by British Co-Workers were sent to several countries in Asia.<p></p><p></p>But Mother Teresa emphasized to her volunteers not to wander away from more humbling tasks, whether it was writing a letter, washing clothes, or reading to the ill.<p></p><p></p>There is also a very special branch of the Co-Workers that was created during the 1960s: the Sick and Suffering Co-Workers. These are indi-viduals who are old, infirm, or handicapped; they cannot help with the more strenuous activities of the other Co-Workers. This group offers prayers for Mother Teresa and the Missionaries of Charity’s efforts. Quite often, these volunteers are linked with a member of the active Co-Workers in their area. Currently there are about 5,000 Sick and Suffering Co-Workers representing 57 countries.<p></p><p></p>THE MEETING POINT<p></p><p></p>In 1968, Oliver Hunkin, head of religious programming for the BBC, called upon noted British journalist Malcolm Muggeridge, to ask whether he would do a short television interview with a relatively unknown nun from India. Hunkin’s choice of Muggeridge was inspired. Muggeridge was well known for his agnosticism and mocking attitude toward organized re-ligions. Having briefly entertained thoughts of becoming a priest at a young age, Muggeridge instead chose journalism as a career. However, he never completely let go of his deep Christian feelings, and much later in life returned to the Church. But for now, Muggeridge was a bit put out at the thought of conducting this interview, particularly since Hunkin had not given him much notice in order for him to prepare.<p></p><p></p>Muggeridge had never heard of Mother Teresa, but the next afternoon he found himself making his way to the Holy Child Convent in London to do the interview. Mother Teresa, looking visibly nervous, answered Muggeridge’s questions in a small, halting voice. Gently, he led her through the story of her mission and what she hoped to accomplish, and avoided controversial questions completely; nor was there any appeal for donations on her part. At one point, Muggeridge feared that he would not be able to keep the interview going for the full 30 minutes. When the completed interview was broadcast for BBC executives, there was even some question about whether the lackluster and ordinary exchange should be televised.<p></p><p></p>But in the end, the interview aired in May 1968 on the BBC Sunday-night series, Meeting Point. The response was as unexpected as it was spectacular. So many British viewers were moved by the story of Mother<p></p> 
THE GROWTH OF A MIRACLE	103
<p></p>Teresa and the Missionaries of Charity, that within 10 days of the broad-cast, £9,000 ($16,000 in 2004 dollars) were donated to the organization. Another story credits the interview with raising £25,000 (approximately $45,000 in 2004 dollars). Although the actual figure is in dispute, one thing is not: Mother Teresa struck a chord with the public. BBC officials were so taken aback by the response to the interview that they broadcast it again with even more donations coming in for the Missionaries of Charity.<p></p><p></p>AN ACTUAL MIRACLE?<p></p><p></p>What, on the surface, appeared to have been a run-of-the-mill inter-view had a very profound effect on Malcolm Muggeridge. Later, he ad-mitted that when he first saw Mother Teresa walk into the room, she appeared unique and significant. He was also very excited about the pos-sibility of working with her again and asked the BBC to send him to Cal-cutta where he could film Mother Teresa in action.<p></p><p></p>In the spring of 1969, Muggeridge, accompanied by a cameraman and producer, left for Calcutta. Although initially reluctant to agree to the re-quest, Mother Teresa eventually relented and gave the film crew her full cooperation. For the next five days, Muggeridge and his team followed Mother Teresa as she went about her daily routine. But it was the filming at Nirmal Hriday in which Muggeridge later claimed to have witnessed a photographic miracle.<p></p><p></p>Initially, both Muggeridge and Kenneth Macmillan, the cameraman, were reluctant to shoot inside the home because of the dimly lit interior. As it was, Macmillan had only a small light with him, and to get adequate light seemed an impossible task. However, he had recently purchased some new Kodak film, which he had not tried yet. He decided to go ahead and shoot footage inside Nirmal Hriday using the new film. When Mug-geridge and his team returned to London, they began work on the docu-mentary. Several weeks later, as they were reviewing rushes, or the unedited film footage, they watched for the first time the sequence shot at Nirmal Hriday. Macmillan recounted what happened next:<p></p><p></p>It was surprising. You could see every detail. And I said: “That’s amazing, that’s extraordinary.” And I was going to say . . . three cheers for Kodak. I didn’t get a chance to say that though be-cause Malcolm, sitting in the front row, spun round and said: “It’s divine light! It’s Mother Teresa. You’ll find that it’s divine light old boy.”1<p></p> 
104	MOTHER TERESA<p></p><p></p>Macmillan also found himself besieged over the next several days by newspaper reporters asking him about the miracle he had witnessed.<p></p><p></p>The completed documentary Something Beautiful for God was shown for the first time in December 1969. It was a resounding success. Later, Mug-geridge, Macmillan, and Peter Chafer, the producer, credited Mother Teresa for the film’s reception, citing her as an extremely charismatic pres-ence. However, both Chafer and Macmillan were reluctant to attribute the extraordinary lighting sequence at Nirmal Hriday to Divine Provi-dence, even though when Macmillan used the film again in a low-light situation he got poor results.<p></p><p></p>The documentary not only boosted Mother Teresa’s image worldwide, it also had an impact on the Missionaries of Charity. As a result of the film, there was a visible increase in the numbers of young women wishing to join the order. In 1970, a year after the documentary aired, 139 new candidates were received by the Missionaries of Charity. The new arrivals came from all over: Pakistan, Ceylon, Nepal, Malaysia, Yugoslavia, Ger-many, Malta, France, Mauritania, Ireland, Venezuela, Italy, and India. The total of the entire congregation stood at 585, of which 332 were fully professed nuns, 175 novices, and 78 postulants, a remarkable achieve-ment for an order barely two decades old.<p></p><p></p>NOTE<p></p><p></p>Anne Sebba, Mother  Teresa:  Beyond  the  Image  (New York: Doubleday,<p></p><p></p>1997), p. 83.<p></p> 
<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Chapter  9<p></p><p></p>BLESSINGS AND BLAME<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Thanks to the amazing success of the documentary Something Beautiful for God, Mother Teresa no longer just belonged to Calcutta or to India. She belonged to the world. Malcolm Muggeridge, the journalist who now emerged as one of Mother Teresa’s most vocal and supportive champions, went on to write a book published under the same title in 1971. Using the transcript from the film as the basis of the text and incorporating many black and white photographs, the book illustrated Mother Teresa’s work and life. Muggeridge also included nine pages of Mother Teresa’s sayings, stating that, since Mother Teresa would never write about herself or her work, there should be a record of her own words.<p></p><p></p>The book enjoyed phenomenal success. It has rarely gone out of print, and over 30 years, has sold more than 300,000 copies. It has been reprinted 20 times and has been translated into 13 languages. Upon his death in 1990, Muggeridge donated the royalties from the book to Mother Teresa, the sum of which is about £60,000.<p></p><p></p>Between the film, the book, and Mother Teresa’s own globe-trotting, both she and her order were very much in the public eye. Although that visibility was beneficial, particularly as Mother Teresa was trying to raise funds and awareness of the world’s poor, it also left her vulnerable to grow-ing dissent, criticism, and accusations. Despite Muggeridge’s predictions that Mother Teresa would one day be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, her application for the coveted award was rejected three times.<p></p><p></p>NEW ADVENTURES<p></p> 
<p></p>During the 1970s Mother Teresa continued her travels, both speaking and opening new homes for the Missionaries of Charity. The decade<p></p> 
106	MOTHER TERESA<p></p><p></p>opened with a home established in Amman, Jordan. In December 1970, a novitiate, or center to train newcomers, opened in England; homes for the Missionaries opened in London’s Paddington District and the Bronx, New York City in 1971. Mother Teresa and her Missionaries did not shy away from the world’s troubled spots: in 1972, a new foundation opened in Belfast, Northern Ireland; in 1973, Mother Teresa opened another foun-dation working with the 380,000 Arab refugees who lived and worked in the Israeli-occupied Gaza strip. And so it continued throughout the de-cade with the high point coming in 1979 when the Missionaries of Char-ity opened 14 new foundations. As her missions spread across the world, Mother Teresa enjoyed the support of many world leaders. In the United States alone, she counted among her champions the wealthy Democratic Kennedy family and former Republican president Richard M. Nixon.<p></p><p></p>She also began receiving a number of honors. Her first came in 1962 when she was awarded the Magsaysay Award for International Un-derstanding. That same year she received the Padma Shri, known as the Magnificent Lotus, India’s second highest award. First, after hearing the news that she won, Mother Teresa would not accept it. However, after re-ceiving permission, she traveled to New Delhi to accept the award from the president of India at that time, Dr. Rajendra Prasad.<p></p><p></p>In many cases, the awards came with substantial cash prizes. For in-stance, the money received from the Magsaysay award was used to pur-chase a home for children. In January 1971, Mother Teresa traveled to Rome where she accepted a check from Pope Paul VI for £10,000 (appx. $17,000) after being awarded the first Pope John XXIII Peace Prize. That money was directed toward the building of a leper colony on land donated by the Indian government. In 1971, she again traveled to New Delhi to accept from the Indian government the Nehru Award for International Understanding. In 1973, Mother Teresa became the first recipient of the Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion. She was chosen out of a field of 2,000 nominations by a panel of judges representing the world’s major re-ligions including Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Buddhism, and Hinduism. In every case, Mother Teresa graciously accepted each award in the name of the world’s poor.<p></p><p></p>BATTLING SPIRITUAL POVERTY<p></p><p></p>Mother Teresa was most familiar with the conditions of the poor in Third-World countries; however, when confronted with the poverty in Western countries, she was not only shocked but appalled. On more than one occasion, she noted with some irony how people in the West sent do-<p></p> 
BLESSINGS AND BLAME	107
<p></p>nations to her to help the poor in India, when at the same time they turned their backs on those in their own countries who were suffering and forgotten. In many areas, the Missionaries of Charity opened up Homes of Compassion for the destitute men and women living on the streets. The nuns also made a point of checking on the elderly and lonely who had no one to look after them.<p></p><p></p>For Mother Teresa, the poverty that confronted her in such societies as the United States and Great Britain was more a poverty of the spirit. It came in the form of loneliness and being unwanted, plaguing the home-less, the drifters, the alcoholics, and the mentally ill left to fend for them-selves. What Mother Teresa found so troubling, as she traveled through the rough neighborhoods of London or New York City, was society’s re-sponse to these people: shunning them, abandoning them, or leaving them at the mercy of those who were stronger.<p></p><p></p>Yet, Mother Teresa did not pass judgment on those societies. Instead, she tried to point out as gently as she could that God did not make the poor people in the world, nor did he create poverty and disorder. Rather, it was because people did not share enough with one another that some had plenty and others went without. When faced with the criticism that helping all the needy in the world was a never-ending and hopeless task, she replied that she and her sisters used themselves to save whom they could, when they could. If pressed hard to reason out her mission as a re-sult of that first foray into the Calcutta slums over 20 years before, she might have been astounded to learn that she and her order had saved tens of thousands of lives. But numbers were meaningless to Mother Teresa; for her, each small act, each kindness extended toward those in need, was done in the name of Christ. That was all.<p></p><p></p>LEADING BY EXAMPLE<p></p><p></p>As the number of foundations grew, Mother Teresa’s schedule became more hectic. Because she kept close watch on the order, leading by exam-ple, it was important that she visit every motherhouse she could to check on the day-to-day goings on. For instance, she believed that the sisters must not waste any donations because others had sacrificed in order that they have them. Medicine and food were to be distributed as soon as pos-sible to prevent spoilage. She asked that the priests who assisted in the spiritual welfare of the sisters not interfere in the internal affairs of the houses, particularly when it came to observing their vows of poverty. At no time should a congregation raise its standard of living; this meant going without simple things such as curtains for the motherhouse or bed-<p></p> 
108	MOTHER TERESA<p></p><p></p>spreads, which were invariably given away. Donations of washing ma-chines, carpets, or other creature comforts were also given away. As Mother Teresa continually reminded her sisters, the poor did without and so must they.<p></p><p></p>She wrote to each house as often as possible offering advice, wisdom, and comfort to her growing number of sisters. She wrote to parents thank-ing them for their daughters who had given their lives in service to God. She reminded her nuns to be cheerful and smile, as God needed and loved those who gave of themselves cheerfully. A cheerful disposition also at-tracted those who might be seeking a vocation with the Missionaries of Charity. She shared news of her travels, her visits with dignitaries, and hu-morous incidents that had occurred.<p></p><p></p>Even as she was becoming more well known, Mother Teresa remained as unobtrusive as possible. She commonly slept in the luggage racks of third-class train compartments or shared a seat on a train or a bus between the wife of a farmer and some livestock. On those occasions when she had a seat to herself, she made the most of it, using the time for reflection, often writing small notes or letters to her sisters and benefactors.<p></p><p></p>Yet, she declined the offers of regular income that were beginning to arise more frequently. She emphasized repeatedly that fund-raising was not her work, fearing that the Missionaries of Charity would become a business rather than a labor of love. She squarely placed her life and that of her congregations in God’s hands, fully trusting that Providence would provide for her needs in helping the poor. Her rejections of some dona-tions were on the face of it astounding, yet completely in character. Once she rejected an offer from New York City’s Cardinal Terence Cooke, which would provide $500 a month for each Sister working in Harlem, asking him if he believed that God was going to be bankrupt in New York City.<p></p><p></p>LOSS AND FAILINGS<p></p><p></p>The 1970s were an extraordinary period of growth for the Missionaries of Charity and of growing recognition for Mother Teresa. Still, the decade was not without its low points as Mother Teresa suffered both personal losses and public failures. She may also have come to realize that not all things were possible through faith and love alone.<p></p><p></p>The year 1970 began with a troubling letter from her sister Aga, who was living with their mother in Tirana, Albania. Drana was in ill health and her condition was worsening. On top of that, life under communist rule was extremely difficult and the two were having a hard time making<p></p> 
BLESSINGS AND BLAME	109
<p></p>ends meet. For Mother Teresa, this was a bitter blow; her divine Provi-dence, which had made possible the impossible, seemed strangely absent now. But she took the news with a strong heart, yet sad that there was nothing she could do to help her mother and sister when she had found ways to help so many others around the world.<p></p><p></p>Yet, June 1970, Mother Teresa had a bittersweet homecoming. The Red Cross extended an invitation to her to visit Yugoslavia. From there she made the journey to Prizren, where her family originated, and then traveled to Skopje, the city of her birth. Here she met with the local bishop and visited the shrine at Letnice, where she had often visited to pray and meditate as a young girl. She made it known that she hoped one day to return to Skopje to open a Missionary of Charity home.<p></p><p></p>Later that year, Drana wrote to her son Lazar stating that her only wish was to see him, his family, and her daughter Gonxha before she died. Both Lazar and Mother Teresa worked hard to bring Aga and Drana to Italy for a reunion. At one point, Mother Teresa, while on a visit to Rome, paid a visit to the Albanian embassy seeking permission to bring her mother and sister to Italy. Lazar, though limited in what he could do, tried working with Catholic Relief Services to help relocate Aga and Drana in the event that they would be allowed to leave. These attempts proved futile: the Al-banian government refused to permit either Aga or Drana to leave the country.<p></p><p></p>Mother Teresa then thought about traveling to Albania. But, to her dismay, she learned that while she might be allowed to enter the country, communist authorities could very well prevent her from leaving. Finally, on July 12, 1972, Mother Teresa received word that her mother had died. Not more than a year later, on August 25, 1973, more sad news came, when she learned that her sister Aga had also died. Mother Teresa’s pain and grief were not so much for herself, but for the mother and sister who suffered.<p></p><p></p>The Missionaries of Charity also suffered severe setbacks during the 1970s. In 1971, after much fanfare, the order opened a house in Belfast, Northern Ireland, in the Catholic ghetto of Ballymurphy. Belfast was, at the time, a city under siege, as Catholic and Protestant factions engaged in almost daily violence. Mother Teresa sent four sisters who came with a violin and two blankets each. The house where they were to live had been previously occupied by a priest who had been shot just as he had finished administering last rites to a wounded man. The house was completely empty and had been the target of vandals. Undaunted, the sisters began working with a small group of Anglican nuns in the hope of helping to end strife in the city.<p></p> 
110	MOTHER TERESA<p></p><p></p>After only 18 months in Belfast, the sisters left, stating that they were unwanted and saw no need to risk further danger to themselves. Mother Teresa preferred to see their leaving, however, not as a failure, but as a call, for the sisters were obviously needed somewhere else. She sent them to Ethiopia where they were to help victims of a terrible drought that rav-aged the country.<p></p><p></p>During the 1980s, the Missionaries of Charity experienced more bad luck, when in March 1980 someone set a fire at a home for destitute women run by the order in Kilburn, London. Ten residents of the shelter and one volunteer died in the blaze. The arsonist was never found. In 1986, two sisters were drowned in Dehra Dun, India, when a wooden bridge collapsed during a heavy rain, sending their ambulance into the river below. Although Mother Teresa offered prayers for the dead, no doubt both incidents weighed heavily upon her.<p></p><p></p>Even more painful for Mother Teresa was the number of professed sis-ters choosing to leave the Missionaries of Charity. Of the original 12 women who became the order’s first nuns, two eventually left, as well as a small number of others over the years. Their reasons for leaving were many: some chose to serve God in another way, others wished to leave be-cause of ill health. Some even fell in love and wished to marry and raise families. Mother Teresa did not resent the women’s choices; in fact she often thanked them for their time and effort in their service to the order. Still, it clearly saddened her to lose members.<p></p><p></p>Despite these setbacks, the Missionaries of Charity continued to grow. By 1979, there were 158 foundations established throughout the world. There were 1,187 professed sisters, 411 novices, and 120 postulants. What was perhaps most amazing about the continued growth of the order was that it came at a time when religious vocations for the Church were gen-erally on the decline. It appeared that the total commitment to a life of poverty and the complete surrender of the self in the service of God held tremendous appeal for women everywhere. For Mother Teresa, the con-tinued arrival of newcomers ready to work for the poor was heartwarming. Each week it seemed a new group left Motherhouse bound for some desti-nation where they were needed. As Mother Teresa once remarked, “If there are poor on the moon, we shall go there too.”1<p></p><p></p>THE FIRST VOLLEY<p></p> 
<p></p>One of the first and fiercest attacks on Mother Teresa’s work came dur-ing a crisis in the newly formed country of Bangladesh. Between 1947 and 1971, before gaining its independence, Bangladesh formed the eastern<p></p> 
BLESSINGS AND BLAME	111
<p></p>part of Pakistan and was called East Pakistan. Before the partition of India into independent India and Pakistan in 1947, the area that now forms Bangladesh, or the “land of Bengal,” had been the eastern part of the Ben-gal province.<p></p><p></p>In December 1971 fighting broke out on the Indo-Pakistan border in the west. The Indian army also invaded East Pakistan and in two weeks had control of the country. The Bangladesh government-in-exile estab-lished itself in Dhaka on December 22, 1971, but in January 1972, the leaders returned to the country to begin governing the new nation.<p></p><p></p>But independence for Bangladesh came at a high price. In the nine months of fighting, three million Bengalis had died and over one million homes had been destroyed. Many of the people killed were professionals— teachers, doctors, lawyers, skilled workers, and engineers. Tea plantations and many jute mills were damaged. Added to this vast physical destruc-tion, including the great damage to the transportation system, was the so-cial disruption of the country. Many of the ten million refugees returned to find their homes in ruins. Some sought shelter in the nearest sewer pipe.<p></p><p></p>In addition, the country suffered great internal strife. Though much of the destruction had been the direct result of actions taken by the Pak-istani army, many non-Bengalis in East Pakistan, the Biharis, had played a role as a paramilitary force, working with the Pakistani army against the Bengalis. After the war, many of the Biharis were placed in camps, and some were killed. The atrocities did not end there. Pakistani troops re-portedly raped 4,000 women, though some place the number as high as 200,000.<p></p><p></p>On January 14, 1972, Mother Teresa announced that she was going to Bangladesh with 10 of her nuns to assist the rape victims, many of whom were now in the advanced stages of pregnancy. Traveling to Khulna, Pabna, Rajshahi, and Dhaka, Mother Teresa and her nuns sought out these women, in the hope of arranging adoptions for as many as possible. Because rape is a very serious crime in Islam, the victim is often ostracized by her family, friends, and perhaps even an entire village. For many women, giving up any children who might have been conceived as a re-sult of the rape was the only option.<p></p><p></p>In Dhaka, the nuns were given the use of an old convent as a home for the women. But there were few who came seeking help. Some victims did not conceive, while others tried to terminate their pregnancies them-selves. Eventually, the convent was turned into another Shishu Bhavan for orphaned and abandoned children.<p></p><p></p>As altruistic as Mother Teresa’s motives may have been, there was at least one person who did not view her actions in Bangladesh in the same<p></p> 
112	MOTHER TERESA<p></p><p></p>light. Australian feminist and writer Germaine Greer, a Roman Catholic, reported in an article written for the magazine the Independent in 1990, another purpose behind Mother Teresa’s humanitarian mission:<p></p><p></p>When she went to Dacca two days after its liberation from the Pakistanis in 1972, 3,000 naked women had been found in the army bunkers. Their saris had been taken away so that they would not hang themselves. The pregnant ones needed abor-tions. Mother Teresa offered them no option but to bear the offspring of hate. There is no room in Mother Teresa’s universe for the moral priorities of others. There is no question of offer-ing suffering women a choice.2<p></p><p></p>But Greer wasn’t done yet. She went on to write that, according to lay workers with whom she had spoken at the time, pregnant women suffer-ing from complications attributed to both physical abuses and malnutri-tion—as well as women who had miscarried—were turned away from Mother Teresa’s clinics. According to Greer, the women had been accused by the Missionaries of Charity working at the clinics of trying to abort their unborn children. Further, when the new Bengali government banned the export of Bengali orphans, Mother Teresa, through some means, was allowed to place Bengali babies with Catholic families abroad. And, according to Greer’s sources, no one at the Family Planning Associ-ation who knew of the incidents was allowed to say anything critical of Mother Teresa or her actions.<p></p><p></p><p></p>THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE<p></p><p></p>By the 1970s, Mother Teresa had emerged as a powerful human-interest story for newspapers and magazines around the world. This tiny nun, barely over five feet tall, had a number of powerful leaders and politicians as her friends. In spite of the growing number of financial donations made to the Missionaries of Charity, Mother Teresa refused to allow herself any indul-gences that would interfere with her vow of poverty. And, though small in stature, she clearly wielded considerable power.<p></p><p></p>One of the more interesting stories that was done on her during this pe-riod came from Time magazine. In December 1975, the magazine not only devoted a long article to her, but also chose her for the cover of the mag-azine. Mother Teresa explained that she only agreed to sit for the photog-rapher after having prayed at mass that morning. She asked God, that for every picture the photographer took, one soul be released from purgatory.<p></p> 
BLESSINGS AND BLAME	113
<p></p>The article “Saints among Us,” besides providing an overview of Mother Teresa’s work, also suggested that many supporters considered her a living saint, a title Mother Teresa herself rejected. The article also dis-cussed the qualities that made a saint. For instance, many saints lived their lives outside of conventional society and were often considered mis-fits. People, then, who tended to conform to cultural norms rarely went on to exhibit saintly qualities. As one theology professor noted, saints tend to be on the outer edge along with the maniacs, geniuses, and idiots. Saints also broke the rules of society in order to carry out their work.<p></p><p></p>The Time magazine article highlighted not only Mother Teresa’s saintly qualities, but also her shrewd sense of organization and her great compas-sion for the poor. However, the article also went on to point out that there were a number of individuals who had also devoted their lives to the poor, but who were not as well known as Mother Teresa. These included Dorothy Day, founder of the Catholic Worker Movement; the Norwegian medical missionary Annie Skau, who lived and worked in Hong Kong; Dr. Cicely Saunders, founder of the Hospice movement; and the Coptic monk Matta el Meskin, also known as Matthew the Poor.<p></p><p></p>By this time, Mother Teresa had received numerous accolades and awards. Still, there were many who believed that she was overlooked and wished her to receive what they considered to be the most important and prestigious award in the world: the Nobel Peace Prize.<p></p><p></p>Those who select nominees for the Nobel Peace Prize may be from one of seven categories, including members of the International Court of Arbitration in The Hague; active and former members of the Nobel Committee of the Norwegian Parliament; advisors appointed by the Norwegian Nobel Institute; university professors of political science, law, history, and philosophy; and lastly, those who have won the prize themselves.<p></p><p></p>Mother Teresa had first been nominated for the prize in 1972, but no prize was awarded that year. Many of her supporters, among them Mal-colm Muggeridge, again put her name in nomination in 1975. This time her nomination was supported by a number of important and influential individuals including Senator Edward Kennedy; Robert McNamara, then head of the World Bank; the National Council of Catholic Women; the Mayor of Addis Ababa; the head of the UN Disaster Relief Organization, Faruk Berkol; and a number of nuns in Spain.<p></p><p></p>But the prize eluded her again and went instead to Andrei Sakharov, the noted Russian scientist and human rights advocate. In 1977, Mother Teresa’s name was put forth yet another time. Again the Nobel commit-tee passed her over for the award, which was instead given to the organi-<p></p> 
114	MOTHER TERESA<p></p><p></p>zation Amnesty International for championing human rights around the world. She later joked that the prize would only come to her when Jesus thought it was time.<p></p><p></p>Then, in 1979, her name was put forward again, only with much less fanfare. Although the name of the person who put forward Mother Teresa’s name has never been publicly acknowledged, it is thought to have been Robert McNamara. McNamara had known Mother Teresa for al-most two decades and was very familiar with her work with the poor. He had also worked with her on occasion in the Food for Peace program. In 1975, writing about Mother Teresa and her work, McNamara stated:<p></p><p></p>More important than the organisational structure of her work is the message it conveys that genuine peace is not the mere absence of hostilities, but rather that tranquility that arises out of a social order in which individuals treat one another with justice and compassion. The long history of human conflict suggests that without greater recognition of that fact—a fact which Mother Teresa’s concern for the absolute poor strikingly so illustrates—the prospects for world peace will remain per-ilously fragile.3<p></p><p></p>Then, on October 16, 1979, came the announcement that many had waited for: the Nobel committee awarded the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize to Mother Teresa. In the wake of the pronouncement, some nagging ques-tions remained. Why, for instance, did the committee choose Mother Teresa this time and not others? Who had, in fact, nominated her? But be-cause the committee’s meetings are kept secret, no one will ever know what took place during the deliberations for the award.<p></p><p></p>Meanwhile, in Calcutta, Mother Teresa was mobbed when the news was announced. Journalists and photographers jostled one another as they tried to talk to Mother Teresa to get her reaction to the good news. Stand-ing in front of the Motherhouse, she spoke to the gathering media about the news, stating “I am unworthy. I accept the prize in the name of the poor. The prize is the recognition of the poor world. . . . By serving the poor I am serving him.” A reception was held in her honor in which one offi-cial proclaimed, “You have been the mother of Bengal and now you are the mother of the world.”4 That same day, a small abandoned baby girl was brought into the Shishu Bhavan in Calcutta. She was named Shanti, which means “Peace” in Hindi, in honor of Mother Teresa’s award.<p></p><p></p>The celebrations had just begun. Over the next few days, Mother Teresa received more than 500 telegrams from heads of state all over the<p></p> 
BLESSINGS AND BLAME	115
<p></p>world. Letters of praise and congratulations also poured in. Many people stopped by Motherhouse to offer their congratulations and best wishes. Many in India rejoiced that the prize had once again come to their coun-try; six decades earlier, the Nobel committee had awarded the same prize to Mahatma Gandhi. The government also issued a commemorative postage stamp in Mother Teresa’s honor. Many people rejoiced around the world, that, for once, the Nobel committee had put politics to the side and picked a true humanitarian, one who easily matched the stature of previous winners such as Albert Schweitzer, Gandhi, and Martin Luther King, Jr. Other people believed that by winning the Nobel Peace Prize, Mother Teresa had enhanced the prestige of the award.<p></p><p></p>Still, there were detractors. Some of the most vocal dissent came from an extremist anti-Gandhian group that published an article “Nothing Noble about the Nobel”:<p></p><p></p>For when all is said and done, she is a missionary. In serving the poor and the sick, her sole objective is to influence people in favour of Christianity and, if possible to convert them. Mis-sionaries are instruments of Western imperialist countries— and not innocent voices of God.5<p></p><p></p>Another critic wrote to The New York Times stating that his under-standing of the Nobel Peace Prize was that it was to be given to an indi-vidual who made important contributions to world peace, not to someone who merely helped individuals in distress. Another article, in the National Catholic Reporter, suggested that Mother Teresa and her Missionaries of Charity merely covered the wounds left by capitalism and that they did little in the way of actually helping to change the conditions that make people poor. In general, the hubbub over Mother Teresa’s winning of the prize overshadowed the winners of the other Nobel prizes that year.<p></p><p></p>ON TO OSLO<p></p><p></p>In December 1979, Mother Teresa, accompanied by four other nuns, traveled to Oslo to receive the Nobel Prize medal and a check for £90,000 (appx. $161,000). In addition, there was another check of £36,000 (appx. $64,000) awaiting her, which was a donation raised by the young people of Norway. Another £3,000 (appx. $5,300) was later presented to her after she requested that the monies spent on the cus-tomary banquet given in honor of the recipient instead be given to those who needed a meal more.<p></p> 
116	MOTHER TERESA<p></p><p></p>It was a bitterly cold day and many people in the audience were bun-dled up in fur coats and hats in the Aula Magna of Oslo University where Mother Teresa was slated to give her remarks and receive her prize. In the crowd were the king and crown princess of Norway, along with many other world dignitaries. The stage was banked with lush floral arrange-ments; nearby, a symphony orchestra played selections from Edvard Grieg, the great Norwegian composer. Wearing only a gray cardigan sweater and black coat over her thin cotton sari, Mother Teresa made her way to the podium. After asking her audience to join her in prayer, she then began her speech. According to the reporter for the magazine Na-tional Review, Mother Teresa’s speech was not only on the poor, but on abortion, stating that nations who allowed legalized abortions are really the poorest of all. She further argued that the most horrendous crime of all existed “against the innocent unborn child.”6<p></p>Another journalist wrote that Mother Teresa went on to state:<p></p><p></p>I feel that the greatest destroyer of peace today is abortion. Be-cause it is a direct war, a direct killing—direct murder by the mother herself. . . . Because if a mother can kill her own child— what is left but for me to kill you and you to kill me—there is nothing in between.7<p></p><p></p>Mother Teresa also spoke of the great spiritual poverty of the West:<p></p><p></p>Around the world, not only in the poor countries, I found the poverty of the West so much more difficult to remove. . . . a per-son that has been thrown out from society—that poverty is so hurtful and so much, that I find it very difficult. Our Sisters are working amongst that kind of people in the West.8<p></p><p></p>Even though the Norwegian paper Aftenposten commented how the press was spellbound by the tiny nun who won the award, there were numerous others who were critical of her remarks. In the aftermath of her speech, one thing was clear: Mother Teresa had not only stated her view of abor-tion, but also made it clear she would not change her views. And when given the opportunity, she would speak out on the subject to any who would listen.<p></p><p></p>As if the abortion issue were not controversial enough, Mother Teresa disappointed many Albanians with her comments on the religious perse-cution in Albania. When asked by a reporter for her thoughts on the sub-ject, Mother Teresa demurred, stating that she could not say much<p></p> 
BLESSINGS AND BLAME	117
<p></p>because she did not know what was going on. But, as more than one critic has pointed out, the fact that she was in contact with her mother and sis-ter until they died, along with her repeated attempts to get them out of the country, or at least to gain permission to visit, demonstrate that Mother Teresa, in fact, knew well the conditions present in the country. In addition, earlier that year, Mother Teresa had met with the widow of the Albanian king, Queen Geraldine, when the country’s predicament surely would have been discussed.<p></p><p></p>In the wake of the Nobel Prize ceremonies, many of Mother Teresa’s supporters stated that she did not comment on the Albanian question be-cause she refused to become involved in any controversial political stances, as that was incompatible with her primary mission: helping the poor. But her detractors point out that, by making her comments on abor-tion, Mother Teresa was in fact involving herself in what was clearly one of the most heated political arguments of the day.<p></p><p></p><p></p>DAPHNE RAE AND LOVE UNTIL IT HURTS<p></p><p></p>Following Mother Teresa’s winning of the Nobel Prize, activity at the Motherhouse at 54A Lower Circular Road picked up considerably. Offers and donations poured in from all over the world, as many companies and individuals offered to help the Missionaries of Charity. From Bata Shoe Company came leather for leprosy patients to make shoes. Help the Aged, a nonprofit organization based in England, donated money for meals. An international organization, the Rotary Club, also pledged money and help for Mother Teresa. Also aiding Mother Teresa in her work were many wealthy individuals who gave both time and money for the poor.<p></p><p></p>One of these volunteers was Daphne Rae, who came to Calcutta to work in the slums. Rae was the wife of the headmaster of Westminster, one of the best schools in England. Rae, originally from Sri Lanka, con-verted to Catholicism in 1977 and came to Calcutta in 1979, leaving her husband and six children to work with Mother Teresa. Altogether, she traveled to the city three times in order to work with the Missionaries of Charity. She brought with her large donations of medical supplies and medicines and spent much of her time at Nirmal Hriday and the chil-dren’s home. But, suddenly, Rae stopped working with Mother Teresa, and instead devoted her energy to working with lesser-known organizations also dedicated to helping India’s poor.<p></p><p></p>Although she never publicly stated why she no longer worked with the Missionaries of Charity, Rae’s 1981 book, Love until It Hurts: Mother<p></p> 
118	MOTHER TERESA<p></p><p></p>Teresa and Her Missionaries of Charity, offers some clues about her change of heart. Rae, who had previously worked with the terminally ill and dying, was no stranger to places such as Nirmal Hriday. However, she was distressed that while helping Mother Teresa, she saw disposable hypoder-mic needles used over and over again; in some cases as many as 40 or 50 times.<p></p><p></p>Rae, who was also a passionate opponent of abortion, was bothered by the approach the nuns took toward single, pregnant mothers at the Shishu Bhavan. For a young, unmarried Hindu girl to become pregnant was a scandal, and for many, abortion was often seen as the only solution. For those unwilling to terminate their pregnancy, there was the possibil-ity of sanctuary at the Shishu Bhavan. Often these girls were taken in by the nuns with the understanding that they would receive a place to sleep, medical care, and help in placing the infant up for adoption in return for helping with domestic chores. According to Rae, these arrangements in fact often resulted in the girls being treated as the lowliest form of servant with only the barest of necessities provided for them. She also found a kind of moral superiority on the part of the nuns, certainly not in keeping with the charitable expressions toward unmarried women espoused in public by the order.<p></p><p></p>A WOMAN IN DEMAND<p></p><p></p>Beginning in the 1980s, Mother Teresa stepped up her visits, traveling all over the world to meet with world leaders or to open another founda-tion somewhere for the Missionaries of Charity. Her travels kept her away from Motherhouse even more; it was usual for her to be gone for 10 months out of every year. At the behest of Pope John Paul II, with whom she developed a very close relationship, Mother Teresa used her travels and the media attention to air her views, giving her a platform second to none among religious leaders.<p></p><p></p>The new decade opened with Mother Teresa traveling again to her hometown of Skopje as a guest of the city. Months earlier, she also had the opportunity to open a house for the elderly in Zagreb, Croatia, mark-ing the first time the Missionaries of Charity had opened one of their homes in a communist country. She attended a conference on family life in Guatemala; then went to visit the desperately poor island of Haiti, where she met the then-president Jean-Claude “Baby Doc” Duvalier and his wife. From Haiti, she traveled to Egypt where, much to the Egyptian government’s dismay, she urged Egyptian housewives to have many chil-dren. The government, which had just finished producing a series of<p></p> 
BLESSINGS AND BLAME	119
<p></p>short films that urged families to limit the number of children, could do nothing.<p></p><p></p>In addition to Mother Teresa’s traveling, the Missionaries of Charity opened a number of new facilities throughout the world. In 1980, 14 new homes were opened; in 1981, 18. Twelve Missionaries of Charity founda-tions opened in 1982; in 1983, the number rose to 14. At the beginning of the decade, the Missionaries of Charity established 140 slum schools, a daily meal program that fed nearly 50,000 persons at 304 centers. There were 70 Shishu Bhavans, which took care of approximately 4,000 chil-dren, out of which 1,000 adoptions were arranged. There were 81 homes for the dying and 670 mobile clinics that had treated some 6 million pa-tients. Although the Missionaries of Charity were going global with their work, the bulk of their endeavors were still based in India.<p></p><p></p>Mother Teresa also continued to show little regard for her own personal safety as she ventured into many of the world’s hotspots. In 1982, she went to West Beirut where the area’s hospitals had been shelled by Israeli ar-tillery. While there, she took 37 children who had been stranded in a men-tal hospital on a Red Cross convoy into East Beirut and safety. In 1984, she traveled to Bhopal, India, where a poisonous gas leak at a Union Carbide plant killed thousands of people and left many others in terrible health.<p></p><p></p>During this period, Mother Teresa also plunged into the growing AIDS crisis. She opened a hospice in Greenwich Village in New York City to care for patients who were suffering from what she termed as the new lep-rosy of the West. Among her first patients were three convicts suffering from the disease in the notorious Sing-Sing Prison near New York City. But despite her willingness to tackle the deadly disease and provide hos-pice care, Mother Teresa was criticized for her handling of AIDs patients. According to one account, a doctor who was also working at the hospice was appalled by how little the nuns knew about the disease. The doctor told Mother Teresa that simply wearing a crucifix around her neck offered her no protection from the disease. To this, Mother Teresa replied that God would take care of her. But for critics this argument was flawed at best, and dangerous at worst, as the account illustrates: “God never pro-vides knowledge or skill. God in fact is never enough. . . . [T]he teresan community sees it [AIDS] as a sickness that can be assuaged with loving words and a little hot soup.”9<p></p><p></p>THE SAINT AND THE SINNER<p></p> 
<p></p>In 1985 came one of the oddest pairings the world had seen: that of a young, anti-Catholic Irish rock musician and the tiny nun who worked<p></p> 
120	MOTHER TERESA<p></p><p></p>with the world’s poor. On the face of it, the idea of rock star Bob Geldof, lead singer of the Boomtown Rats, meeting with Mother Teresa not only seemed odd; it was completely incongruous. But the two actually had something in common: working to help the poor.<p></p><p></p>Geldof, an Irish Catholic who had little use for the Church of his youth, had come to the forefront during 1984 for his concert Band Aid to raise money for the poor in Africa. In 1985, he was traveling to Ethiopia to help distribute the funds raised. He met Mother Teresa at the Addis Ababa airport in January 1985. Geldof remembered, upon greeting her, how tiny she was. He towered more than two feet above her. He de-scribed her as a battered, wizened woman whose most striking character-istic was her feet. Mother Teresa’s sandals were beaten up pieces of leather; her feet were gnarled and misshapen. When Geldof tried to kiss her, Mother Teresa bowed her head quickly so that he could only kiss the top of her wimple. This bothered Geldof a great deal. He later found out that she only let lepers kiss her.<p></p><p></p>As photographers snapped their picture, Mother Teresa and Geldof began talking, she about the Missionaries of Charity, he about his band, the Boomtown Rats. He even offered to arrange a benefit concert for her work. But she gently refused him, stating that God would provide for her. As Geldof later recounted, he had an opportunity to see Providence in action. Upon arriving in the city, Mother Teresa had seen some vacant buildings and asked if she could have the buildings to use as orphanages. Flummoxed government officials, not wanting to turn her down, clearly did not know what to do. But it was clear that Mother Teresa knew about the buildings beforehand. When the official told her he would find her a building for her orphanages, she reminded him that she needed two buildings for two orphanages, not one.<p></p><p></p>When asked later for his impression of Mother Teresa, Geldof replied that she was the embodiment of moral good, but also added that there was nothing otherworldly about her. She showed herself fully capable of han-dling the media and could manipulate them easily. He also found her de-void of any false modesty or pretense; she was totally selfless in her work and seemed genuinely to care about the people she was helping.<p></p><p></p>In 1986, Mother Teresa made further headlines when she traveled to the Soviet Union to meet with government officials. Two years later, she returned with four nuns to begin working in a Moscow hospital helping victims of an earthquake. Her visit was unprecedented and marked the first time that a religious mission was allowed to open a house since the Russian Revolution in 1917.<p></p> 
BLESSINGS AND BLAME	121
<p></p>AN UNHAPPY VISIT<p></p><p></p>In 1988, Mother Teresa traveled to London to visit with Prime Minis-ter Margaret Thatcher. She also visited Cardboard City, the site of the city’s homeless. She asked Thatcher for help in setting up a hostel for them, but Thatcher pointed out that there were voluntary organizations in the city that specifically worked with the homeless, and there was no need for Mother Teresa’s help.<p></p><p></p>There were other problems as well. Mother Teresa’s trip coincided with a hearing in Parliament for a bill that would reduce the time limit for al-lowing abortions from the current 28 weeks to 18 weeks. Mother Teresa again went to Thatcher asking her to support the bill. Again she was re-fused. At a conference in Oxford, Mother Teresa told the audience that couples who used contraception other than the rhythm method, as al-lowed by the Catholic Church, would not be accepted as potential adop-tive parents for any children coming from the Missionaries of Charity homes.<p></p><p></p>Shortly afterward, Mother Teresa met with Robert Maxwell, the Aus-tralian owner of the London newspaper the Daily Mirror. Maxwell, al-ready known for his dubious business dealings, offered to help raise money for a new Missionaries of Charity home in London. Maxwell loved the publicity, and Mother Teresa, either in the dark about Maxwell’s personal business dealings or refusing to acknowledge them, accepted his offer. It also allowed her a chance to do something without going through gov-ernment channels. In all, £169,000 (appx. $302,000) was raised and de-posited in an account held by Maxwell and the paper. In addition, another £90,000 (appx. $160,000) was raised by the readers of a Scottish paper to be used for Mother Teresa’s efforts. With the funds, she hoped to set up two facilities for the homeless in London.<p></p><p></p>But Mother Teresa never saw the money. Some speculated that Maxwell had appropriated the funds. A spokesman for the Daily Mirror later charged that Mother Teresa never seemed to find an appropriate home or piece of land to suit her purposes. He further denied that any of the money was missing. There was also the stigma attached of having ac-cepted the money in the first place from a man who was a known swindler and unsavory businessman. If Mother Teresa had any regrets about any of her actions, her association with Maxwell was one. Finally, though, in 1993, a 35-room hostel was opened in London for the Missionaries of Charity. Mother Teresa came for the opening ceremony and once again thanked readers of the Daily Mirror for their generosity. Mother Teresa<p></p> 
122	MOTHER TERESA<p></p><p></p>complained, though, that officials of the British government did little to ease the suffering of homeless in their country, despite her offers of help.<p></p><p></p>Although the last 20 years had brought great recognition for Mother Teresa and her organization, it was also a period of loss, regret, and con-troversy. With a new decade looming before her, Mother Teresa, at the age of 80, showed no signs of slowing down. However, the coming years would be less than kind to her, both personally and professionally, as she strove to continue her work with the poor.<p></p><p></p>NOTES<p></p><p></p>Kathryn Spink, Mother Teresa (San Francisco: Harper & Row, 1997), p. 102.<p></p><p></p>Germaine Greer, “Heroes and Villains,” Independent, September 22, 1990.<p></p><p></p>Raghu Rai and Navin Chawla, Mother Teresa: Faith and Compassion (Rock-port, Mass.: Element, 1992), p. 184; Anne Sebba, Mother Teresa: Beyond the Image (New York: Doubleday, 1997), p. 100.<p></p><p></p>Eileen Egan, Such a Vision of the Street: Mother Teresa—The Spirit and the Work (Garden City, N.Y.: Image Books, 1986), p. 396.<p></p><p></p>Egan, Vision, p. 398.<p></p><p></p>“The Week,” National Review, January 4, 1980, p. 12.<p></p><p></p>Nobel Foundation, “Mother Teresa Nobel Lecture,” http://www.nobel.se/ peace/laureates/1979/teresa-lecture.html (accessed November 19, 2003).<p></p><p></p>Nobel Foundation, “Mother Teresa Nobel Lecture,” http://www.nobel.se/ peace/laureates/1979/teresa-lecture.html (accessed November 19, 2003).<p></p><p></p>Anthony Burgess, “Mother Teresa,” Evening Standard, January 3, 1992.<p></p> 
<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Chapter  10<p></p><p></p>“THE MOST OBEDIENT WOMAN IN THE CHURCH”<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Even though Mother Teresa kept up her busy schedule, it was clear by the early 1990s that traveling from place to place, visiting many of the world’s most troubled spots, could not last forever. Beginning in 1989, her health began deteriorating. In September of that year, she suffered a near-fatal heart attack and underwent major surgery. The heart trouble was not new; she had first been diagnosed with it almost 15 years earlier. Still, she con-tinued her frenetic pace.<p></p><p></p>After being fitted with a pacemaker in December 1989, Mother Teresa traveled to establish new homes for the Missionaries of Charity. But in 1991, she was hospitalized again, this time at the Scripps Clinic and Re-search Foundation in La Jolla, California, where she was treated for heart disease and bacterial pneumonia. Later, she took ill while visiting in Ti-juana, Mexico, and doctors were forced to perform surgery to open a blood vessel.<p></p><p></p>Although increasingly frail, Mother Teresa did not slow down. Then, in 1993, while in Rome, she fell and broke her ribs. That July, she was hospitalized for two days in Bombay for exhaustion; not more than a month later, she was back in the hospital in New Delhi, this time for a malarial infection, which was further complicated by heart and lung problems. She was transferred to the All India Institute of Medical Sci-ences, where she recuperated in the intensive-care coronary unit. She was home in Calcutta for less than a month, when she was treated by doctors yet again, this time for a blocked heart vessel. Clearly, age and the years of deprivation, travel, and work were taking their toll on Mother Teresa’s health.<p></p> 
124	MOTHER TERESA<p></p><p></p>UNWILLING TO LET GO<p></p><p></p>By 1990, given her ill health, Mother Teresa began giving serious thought to stepping down as head of the Missionaries of Charity. She even went as far as to inform Pope John Paul II of her intentions. Yet, she did nothing. Some people believed that Mother Teresa did not wish to relin-quish control of the order she had founded. Others thought that she feared a sudden drop in donations if she stepped down. Therefore, it was crucial to the survival of the order and their mission that she remain at the helm.<p></p><p></p>Even among her supporters, Mother Teresa’s refusal to appoint a suc-cessor was troubling. For many, building up what had become a major in-stitution with a tremendous amount of goodwill and money, but not looking ahead to the future seemed short-sighted and egocentric. Church leaders were also concerned; clearly, it was time for a younger, more vig-orous leader to take over the order. Mother Teresa’s supporters also feared that the great goodwill she had built up would somehow be negated by her ill health. One supporter, working in the Vatican, also believed that, even if she stepped down, Mother Teresa would still stay involved in the order. She could concentrate on things such as the daily administration and ed-ucation, which did not require the exhaustive traveling that she did. For the time being, Mother Teresa would not consider even a partial retire-ment.<p></p><p></p>Thus, despite her ill health, Mother Teresa continued to respond to new crises around the world. She also continued to receive large financial donations from world leaders. For instance, Yassir Arafat, head of the Palestinian Liberation Organization, presented her personally with a $50,000 check in Calcutta, though he never commented on why he made such a generous donation to the Missionaries of Charity.<p></p><p></p>The last three decades had for the most part been very kind to Mother Teresa. She enjoyed public acclaim and was handled gently by the media. But the attitudes changed in the 1990s. Signaling the perceptible shift was the publication of Germaine Greer’s article about Mother Teresa’s ef-forts in Bangladesh almost 20 years earlier. There was also trouble when it was announced that a movie of Mother Teresa’s life was being planned. Slated to play her was British actress Glenda Jackson and the script was being written by Dominique LaPierre, who had written the best-selling book City of Joy, which described working with Missionaries of Charity. The proposed film even had the Vatican’s support; yet Mother Teresa de-clined to cooperate with the film project and never explained her deci-sion. Newspaper and magazine profiles of her were now often less<p></p> 
“THE MOST OBEDIENT WOMAN IN THE CHURCH” 125<p></p><p></p>flattering, portraying her as demanding and egotistical. This was only por-tent of what lay ahead.<p></p><p></p>HELL’S ANGEL<p></p><p></p>On November 8, 1994, the switchboard operator at the British tele-vision station Channel Four was bombarded by over 200 calls. Many of the callers were irate viewers who had just finished watching a half-hour film called Hell’s Angel, produced by Pakistani-born Tariq Ali, a noted and controversial author and broadcaster. The angel was Mother Teresa, and the tempest surrounding the film, already generating controversy in pre-views, showed no sign of cooling down soon.<p></p><p></p>The film, which featured journalist Christopher Hitchens, made some accusations, many of which had been noted earlier by the British-born Hitchens in his writings for such well-known publications as Vanity Fair and the ultraliberal news magazine Nation. Among the many inflamma-tory statements Hitchens made was that “Mother Teresa has an easy way with thrones, dominions and powers,” and operated “as the roving ambas-sador of [the] highly politicized papacy”1 of Pope John Paul II. In addition, Hitchens charged that Mother Teresa<p></p><p></p>lends spiritual solace to dictators and to wealthy exploiters, which is scarcely the essence of simplicity, and she preaches surrender and prostration to the poor, which a truly humble person would barely have the nerve to do. . . . In a godless and cynical age it may be inevitable that people will seek to praise the self-effacing, the altruistic and the pure in heart. But only a complete collapse of our critical faculties can explain the il-lusion that such a person is manifested in the shape of a dema-gogue, an obscurantist and a servant of earthly powers.2<p></p><p></p>The source of the film was actually Dr. Aroup Chatterjee, a Bengali physi-cian living in London. Dr. Chatterjee, who was born and raised in Cal-cutta, was dismayed at the discrepancy between Mother Teresa’s work and the growing cult-like adulation of her in the West. In a letter written to the production company Bandung, Dr. Chatterjee also stated that Mother Teresa’s assets totaled more than those of many Third-World govern-ments; and that in Calcutta, unlike the West, she was regarded as some-thing of a nonentity. Chatterjee’s greatest objection, though, was in how closely intertwined Mother Teresa’s work and identity were with Cal-cutta, another misconception on the part of the West. Chatterjee pointed<p></p> 
126	MOTHER TERESA<p></p><p></p>out that there were a number of other individuals and groups doing far more for the city’s poor than the Missionaries of Charity, and these groups were completely overlooked.<p></p><p></p>The production company was more than willing to listen to Chatter-jee’s proposal. The company had already, in its short existence, voiced some of the very same grievances that Chatterjee had described. Calcut-tans were annoyed that Western journalists and filmmakers portrayed their city as a place that cared little for the poor, the sick, and the dying. In the 1991 film City of Joy, for example, Calcutta was depicted as little more than a dark pit of misery and despair.<p></p><p></p>The decision to interview Hitchens might at first have seemed odd. But, in fact, he was already quite familiar with Mother Teresa, having first met her in 1980. In a 1992 article called the “Ghoul of Calcutta,” Hitchens described his first encounter with Mother Teresa, whom he de-scribed as the “leathery old saint.” He had stopped at the Missionaries of Charity facility on Bose Road and was immediately put off by the home’s motto “He That Loveth Correction Loveth Knowledge.” Despite his re-action, Hitchens agreed to go along on a walk with Mother Teresa. Ini-tially, he was favorably impressed:<p></p><p></p>I was about to mutter some words of praise for the nurses and was even fumbling in my pocket when Mother Teresa announced: “You see, this is how we fight abortion and contraception in Calcutta.” Mother Teresa’s avowed motive somewhat cheapened the ostensible work of the charity and made it appear rather more like what it actually is: an exercise in propaganda.3<p></p><p></p>As harsh as that initial assessment was, Hitchens had an opportunity in the film to voice even more accusations. Against footage of Mother Teresa that showed her bent and looking down, Hitchens described her connec-tion with the deposed Haitian dictator Jean-Claude “Baby Doc” Duvalier, from whom she accepted large financial donations. Footage was also shown of her laying a wreath at the grave of Enver Hoxha, the ruthless communist dictator of Albania, and meeting with notorious figures in the business world. According to Hitchens, Mother Teresa’s Missionaries of Charity grossed an annual income in the neighborhood of tens of millions of dollars.<p></p><p></p>Hitchens also suggested, as had some of Mother Teresa’s other critics, that if the monies accumulated by the order were kept in Calcutta,<p></p> 
“THE MOST OBEDIENT WOMAN IN THE CHURCH” 127<p></p><p></p>chances are the order would certainly make much more of a difference in working with the poor. Instead, Mother Teresa spread her nuns and their money very thinly trying to open homes throughout the world. Further, Hitchens argued, Mother Teresa chose her convent and the church’s teachings over the work of her clinics.<p></p><p></p>According to the BBC, the Channel Four program did spectacularly: approximately 1.6 million viewers tuned in to watch. In the aftermath of the documentary’s airing, callers phoning the station called the program insulting, hurtful, offensive, obscene, untrue, obnoxious, shocking, and satanic. One viewer even went so far as to accuse the head of the station, Michael Grade, a Jew, of anti-Catholic bias, while both Hitchens and Tariq Ali were branded as Bolsheviks and Marxist revolutionaries. Other viewers believe the film was nothing less than the work of a Judeo-Muslim conspiracy.<p></p><p></p>The Roman Catholic Church understandably rallied to Mother Teresa’s defense, denouncing the program as a grotesque caricature of the woman and her work. Noted Catholic writer and historian Paul Johnson called the documentary a diabolical and malicious attack by left-wing pro-pagandists. Another 130 viewers went so far as to lodge a complaint with the Independent Television Commission, which, after considering the matter, refused to sanction the station for broadcasting the film.<p></p><p></p>In Calcutta, several of Mother Teresa’s supporters rallied to her cause, calling the film biased. As of 2004, the film has yet to be shown in India, due in part to how expensive the film is to sell, though copies are available privately. Mother Teresa was undeterred by the controversy surrounding her. When asked about the film in an interview, she simply stated, “No matter who says what, you should accept it with a smile and do your own work.”4 However, the day after the program was shown, she did cancel a scheduled visit to Taiwan, but did not explain her reasons for doing so to anyone.<p></p><p></p>Despite the backlash against the film and Hitchens, there were those who applauded what the film tried to do. One reviewer writing for the Guardian stated that Hitchens was completely right in questioning what he called the “cult of Teresa.” Another supporter of the program was the Reverend Andrew de Berry, who had met Mother Teresa many years ear-lier when he was a chaplain-in-training. He recalled her telling an audi-ence that she advised the women of Calcutta to have as many children as they wanted. De Berry then wrote that the experience stayed with him al-ways; and undoubtedly many who died on the streets of Calcutta were the children of mothers who took Mother Teresa’s counsel.<p></p> 
128	MOTHER TERESA<p></p><p></p>THE MISSIONARY POSITION<p></p><p></p>After Hell’s Angel Hitchens published a small book that picked up where the film left off. In The Missionary Position: Mother Teresa in Theory and Practice, Hitchens hoped to elaborate on Mother Teresa and her work, by “judging Mother Teresa’s reputation by her actions and words rather than the actions and words by her reputation.”5 According to Hitchens, Mother Teresa’s shining reputation was put upon her by the millions of people who needed to feel that someone, somewhere, is doing the things that they are not to help the poor. Further, Hitchens charged, Mother Teresa fed on this adoration, and, contrary to what she says, has not only come to accept it, but expects and even demands it.<p></p><p></p>Hitchens’s book posed some troubling questions. Among other things, Hitchens questioned how Mother Teresa spent the money she had raised. Hitchens could find no satisfactory answer, and Mother Teresa consis-tently refused to discuss her financial affairs. As Hitchens stated, “The de-cision not to [fund a proper hospital], and to run instead a haphazard and cranky institution which would expose itself to litigation and protest were it run by any branch of the medical profession, is a deliberate one. The point is not the honest relief of suffering but the promulgation of a cult based on death and suffering and subjection.”6<p></p><p></p>Mother Teresa’s apologists have often portrayed her as an innocent who professes to know little of business and politics, and who is concerned only with God and God’s will. In reality, as Hitchens points out, Mother Teresa kept some questionable company over the years. She has received hospitality, awards, publicity, and money from numerous persons with overt political motives or dubious business histories such as Robert Maxwell; the Duvaliers; President Ronald Reagan; Prime Minister Mar-garet Thatcher; President Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary Clinton; and Charles Keating, one of the key figures in the savings and loan scandal of the 1990s. The relationship with Keating was particularly galling. Keating made a generous donation to Mother Teresa as well as making his private jet available for her use. When Keating was imprisoned for fraud and em-bezzlement, Mother Teresa petitioned the trial judge to look kindly on him. When she received a reply from one of the prosecutors, explaining that the $10,000 she had received from Keating was stolen from innocent and not especially wealthy investors, Mother Teresa never answered the letter.<p></p><p></p>Hitchens maintained that such blatant and deliberate disregard for the truth on Mother Teresa’s part was not a sign of naiveté or even stupidity, but rather arrogance. Claiming to be above politics, Mother Teresa also<p></p> 
“THE MOST OBEDIENT WOMAN IN THE CHURCH” 129<p></p><p></p>had the benefit of an almost unprecedented public forum. But while speaking out against abortion in Great Britain, Ireland, and the United States, she remained noticeably silent on the topics of unlawful deaths, murders, and oppression in such political hotspots as Ethiopia, Haiti, and Albania, where she kissed the hands of ruling dictators and willingly took their money and their awards.<p></p><p></p>Her refusal to acknowledge the deep problems of poverty emerged in Hitchens’s description of a 1981 visit that Mother Teresa made to Ana-costia, an African American ghetto in Washington, D.C. At that time, the Missionaries of Charity intended to establish some sort of operation there, though many of the area’s residents did not want to give the im-pression that their neighborhood was helpless and poor like many of the Third World areas in which Mother Teresa worked. Just before a press conference, a group of African American men visited Mother Teresa:<p></p><p></p>They were very upset. . . . They told Mother that Anacostia needed decent jobs, housing and services—not charity. Mother didn’t argue with them; she just listened. Finally one of them asked her what she was going to do here. Mother said: “First we must learn to love one another.” They didn’t know what to say to that.7<p></p><p></p>Hitchens’s book, like the film, had its detractors and admirers. George Sim Johnston, writing for the American conservative publication The National Review, called Hitchens’s work “unresisting imbecility,” and added that “the only good that will come from this book is the prayers the nuns of Mother Teresa’s order are no doubt saying for its author.”8 The New York Times Book Review found that Hitchens’s book is, “zealously overwritten, and rails wildly in defense of an almost nonsensical proposi-tion: that Mother Teresa of Calcutta is actually not a saint but an evil and selfish old woman.” Yet the reviewer concluded that Hitchens had a point: “Ultimately, he argues, Mother Teresa is less interested in helping the poor than in using them as an indefatigable source of wretchedness on which to fuel the expansion of her fundamentalist Roman Catholic be-liefs.”9 The Sunday Times was even more succinct: “Veteran lefty kicks old nun; old nun forgives; lefty doesn’t want to be forgiven.”10<p></p><p></p>Mary Poplin, a journalist writing for Commonweal magazine, visited Calcutta in 1996. She was there to write about Mother Teresa and her work; she also took the opportunity to ask Mother Teresa about the Hitchens’s book. According to Poplin’s account, when questioned about the charge that Mother Teresa was one of the wealthiest women in the<p></p> 
130	MOTHER TERESA<p></p><p></p>world, and that she certainly did not need any more money, Mother Teresa, after a puzzled look, replied, “Oh yes, the book. I haven’t read it but some of the sisters have. It matters not, he [Hitchens] is forgiven.” Poplin laughed and then said, “Yes, Mother, in the end of the book, he says he knew you said you forgave him and he’s irate because he says he didn’t ask you to forgive him and he didn’t need it.” She looked at me as though I hadn’t understood, then gently and confidently instructed me, “Oh, it is not I who forgives, it is God, it is God. God forgives.”11<p></p><p></p>A GROWING MINORITY<p></p><p></p>The bitter arguments over Hitchens’s charges in both Hell’s Angel and The Missionary Position might have ended there, if it had not been for other, more moderate voices also coming forward with their criticisms of Mother Teresa. Dr. Robin Fox, a thoracic specialist and editor of the highly respected medical journal, the Lancet, wrote in 1994 of the poor medical facilities found at Nirmal Hriday in Calcutta. According to Fox, he was astonished to find that there were no simple testing procedures im-plemented to distinguish an incurable from a curable disease: “Such sys-tematic approaches are alien to the ethos of the home. . . . Along with the neglect of diagnosis, the lack of good analgesia marks Mother Teresa’s ap-proach as clearly separate from the hospice movement. I know which I prefer.”12 Further, although it appeared that the poor in the facilities that the Missionaries of Charity operated could not receive even basic treat-ment, Mother Teresa herself had access to the most modern medical treat-ment in the world, especially when her heart problems came to light.<p></p><p></p>Not long after Dr. Fox’s criticism appeared, a thoughtful piece by Clif-ford Longley, a writer and former religious affairs correspondent for the London Times, warned of Mother Teresa’s reverence for death. Such an emphasis, Longley feared, threatened to turn suffering into a goal. In ad-dition, many health workers who visited the clinics and listened to Mother Teresa’s views on abortion wondered how anyone who concerned themselves with the problems of the poor could not also be concerned with the problems of fertility, overpopulation, and other questions of re-productive health. The furor over Hell’s Angel had in fact opened up the debate over Mother Teresa’s work during the last 50 years; for the first time, opposition to her seemed to be emerging and hardening. Was Mother Teresa’s way of dealing with the poor outmoded as some of her critics charged, or, as some of her supporters suggested, would there always be the need for the kind of Christian charity Mother Teresa exemplified?<p></p> 
“THE MOST OBEDIENT WOMAN IN THE CHURCH” 131<p></p><p></p>In her article “No Humanitarian,” Mary Poplin who spent two months working as a volunteer, described the rough conditions of Mother Teresa’s medical facilities:<p></p><p></p>Like many Western visitors, I initially found the experience disorienting. Despite Mother Teresa’s repeated reminders that the order’s mission is religious, not social work, most Western-ers who visit the homes for sick and handicapped children ex-pect them to look like medical clinics or hospitals. They don’t. Most shocking is the absence of hospital-like procedures and equipment. This can be particularly disconcerting for people who have worked in hospital settings in America and Eu-rope. . . . Surely, given Mother Teresa’s fame, such equipment was available?. . . . The Missionaries of Charity, one learns, re-sist owning anything, even medical equipment that is not widely available to the poor.13<p></p><p></p>PUTTING HER HOUSE IN ORDER<p></p><p></p>By the mid-1990s, Mother Teresa was fighting not only ill health but also the growing criticism of her mission. Any ideas she may have had about retiring were now out of the question. Her seemingly contradictory actions and world fame had put her in an uncomfortable position. Yet, she also relied more fully on the advice and support of the other sisters, some of whom believed that Mother Teresa was trying to get her affairs in order.<p></p><p></p>In May 1993, Mother Teresa traveled to Belgium where she was to help celebrate a gathering of Co-Workers. Because so many volunteers were going to attend the meeting in Antwerp, they decided to hold a meeting of the governing body to discuss a Co-Worker chapter that had been planned for San Diego the following year. Many believed the gathering in Antwerp would be a good opportunity to address the organization about some of her concerns.<p></p><p></p>Mother Teresa was scheduled to speak on May 8; however, the evening before, Brother Geoff, General Servant of the Missionary Brothers, an-nounced to the assembly that allegations had been made against the Co-Workers for misuse of funds; monies that should have gone to the poor were thought instead to have been spent on Co-Workers’ travel expenses, newsletters, and postage. He then informed the stunned audience that Mother Teresa was going to dissolve the Co-Workers organization the next day and cancel the San Diego chapter.<p></p> 
132	MOTHER TERESA<p></p><p></p>The announcement came as a terrible shock to the group. But for those who had been with Mother Teresa almost from the beginning, her actions were in character. For those volunteers, working with Mother Teresa had always been a bit of a balancing act: on one hand, she could raise enor-mous amounts of money for the poor; on the other, she had no problem telling the Co-Workers that they could not make Christmas cards in order to raise money. This attitude formed the crux of Mother Teresa’s own con-cern over money; namely that it would become too central a preoccupa-tion for the organization and its volunteers. First and foremost, the work was always to be about the poor. In the end, with the help of Brother Geoff, the Co-Workers convinced Mother Teresa not to disband the group.<p></p><p></p>Plagued by her physical ailments, Mother Teresa battled memory lapses, confusion, and a growing dependency on others. She no longer was as accessible as she had been in years past. For many volunteers, there was the question of whether these changes were hampering her judgment and influencing what they perceived as erratic behavior and inconsistent decisions. Her supporters, however, maintained that Mother Teresa was simply reminding her volunteers not to lose track of their priorities: to live a simple life and maintain a deep spirituality and faith in God.<p></p><p></p>In September 1993, Mother Teresa received sad news; Father Van Exem, the priest who had reluctantly agreed to serve as her spiritual advi-sor over 50 years ago, had died. His death was a terrible blow to Mother Teresa for the two had become close friends. Because she was still recov-ering from her own illness, she could not attend his funeral, but watched sadly from her bedroom window as the funeral procession made its way to St. John’s Cemetery for burial.<p></p><p></p>Shortly before his death, Father Van Exem wrote to Mother Teresa, telling her that he would be offering his prayers for the following inter-cessions: that she would recover from her latest illness of a blocked heart vessel without surgery; that she would travel to China by October of that year; and that God would take him, instead of her. And so it was at the end of October that Mother Teresa arrived in China to arrange for the opening of a home for children. Her visit was a quick one; she stopped in Shanghai and Beijing before going to Rome and then to Poland. She re-turned to China once more in March 1994 with the hope of opening a house for handicapped children. Her wish to establish the Missionaries of Charity failed; China, by 1994, was becoming less open and Mother Teresa turned her energies elsewhere.<p></p> 
“THE MOST OBEDIENT WOMAN IN THE CHURCH” 133<p></p><p></p>MORE CONTROVERSY<p></p><p></p>Mother Teresa’s final years were touched by controversy. In February 1994, she attended a National Prayer Breakfast in Washington, D.C. She did so reluctantly, having been invited by then-President Bill Clinton. She had been asked to speak and did so with much of her speech focusing on the topic of abortion. However, when she was finished, no one at the top table where the president was sitting applauded, though President Clinton later apologized. Mother Teresa did meet Hillary Clinton, who traveled with her daughter, Chelsea, to Calcutta the following year to visit one of the Missionary of Charity homes. With Mrs. Clinton’s help, a children’s shelter operated by the order opened in Washington in June 1995.<p></p><p></p>Two other unhappy events in Calcutta ensnared Mother Teresa. In September 1995, a 15-year-old girl who lived on the city streets was cook-ing a meal. She overturned the fire and was badly burned. A local doctor found her some days later lying outside with third-degree burns and severe damage to one arm. He managed to get the young woman into a state hospital, but it became difficult to obtain the right medications for her. Her relatives removed her and she went back to living on the street. After a month, her wounds became severely infected and so her relatives searched for another facility.<p></p><p></p>By this time, the local press had gotten wind of the story. The Mission-aries of Charity were contacted and they agreed to send an ambulance for the girl. She was first taken to Nirmal Hriday, but was turned away be-cause she was not dying. The next stop was to Shishu Bhavan, where she was turned away again, having been told that she was not an orphan and moreover was married with a child. Her next destination was Prem Dan, but again she was refused admission because she was not suffering from tu-berculosis nor was she insane. In the end, the burn victim was deposited back on the street.<p></p><p></p>The story was a sensation and marked the first time any reporting car-ried a strong bias against Mother Teresa. One reporter asked Mother Teresa about the young woman’s predicament. To his astonishment, Mother Teresa said that she would not discuss the issue. Some told the re-porter that the girl should have been in a hospital, not in one of Mother Teresa’s homes. But, as the reporter later stated, his intent was never to ask Mother Teresa to take the girl, but to ask her why—when she had pur-portedly never refused anyone care or help—she would not admit the girl to one of her facilities. The young girl was eventually taken to another state hospital, but the story had done damage and for many caused con-<p></p> 
134	MOTHER TERESA<p></p><p></p>siderable disillusionment with both Mother Teresa and the Missionaries of Charity.<p></p><p></p>Not more than two months later, Mother Teresa again became em-broiled in controversy, this time of a political nature. This incident also was the first time Church officials in India publicly criticized her, and where she faced the most sustained opposition to her work and philoso-phy. The situation was one of the few times in which Mother Teresa be-came involved in a contentious row that had severe international repercussions.<p></p><p></p>MOTHER TERESA AND THE DALITS<p></p><p></p>On November 18, 1995, Mother Teresa held special prayers at the Sa-cred Heart Cathedral in New Delhi. The occasion was to launch a two-week fast and protest campaign demanding scheduled caste recognition for Christian Dalits. Caste is an important part of Indian society; it is not only a declaration of social status, it determines the course of a person’s life. People born into the highest caste of Indian society were those with property, money, education, and opportunities. The lowest level of Indian society were the Dalits or “untouchables.”<p></p><p></p>In India alone, close to 160 million so-called Dalits, or known legally as scheduled castes, were routinely discriminated against, denied access to land, forced to work in degrading conditions, and routinely abused, even killed, at the hands of the police and of higher-caste groups that enjoyed the state’s protection. The discrimination against and segregation of the Dalits has been called India’s “hidden apartheid,” and entire villages in many Indian states remain completely segregated by caste.<p></p><p></p>Although the practice of “untouchability” was abolished under India’s constitution in 1950, social discrimination against a person or group by reason of birth into a particular caste remains very much a part of rural India. Untouchables may not cross the line dividing their part of the vil-lage from that occupied by members of the higher castes. They may not use the same wells, visit the same temples, drink from the same cups in tea stalls, or lay claim to land that is legally theirs. Dalit children are fre-quently made to sit in the back of classrooms, and Dalit women are fre-quent victims of sexual abuse. Most Dalits continue to live in extreme poverty, without land or opportunities for better employment or edu-cation. With the exception of a minority who have benefited from India’s policy of quotas in education and government jobs, Dalits are relegated to the most menial of tasks, as manual scavengers, removers of human waste and dead animals, leather workers, street sweepers, and cobblers. Dalit<p></p> 
“THE MOST OBEDIENT WOMAN IN THE CHURCH” 135<p></p><p></p>children make up the majority of those sold into bondage to pay off debts to upper-caste creditors.<p></p><p></p>It was the government provision that allowed a small number of Dalits access to government jobs that set off the firestorm. But Dalits who had converted to Christianity were denied this opportunity on the grounds that once a person converted to Christianity, the issue of caste is no longer important. It was also argued that Christian Dalits had other op-portunities available such as studying in Christian schools. Christian Dal-its argued that, in using these educational facilities, they were being denied the country’s resources that as citizens they should have access to. But, as others argued, if Dalits are Christians, they cannot be Dalits, as Christianity does not recognize the notion of caste. If they are Dalits, then they are Hindus, and, as far as Mother Teresa was concerned, she had lit-tle to do with them.<p></p><p></p>Mother Teresa’s involvement with the campaign had tremendous repercussions. Accused of trying to introduce the pattern of caste systems into Christianity at the expense of non-Christian Dalits, Mother Teresa called a press conference in which she stated that she had no idea what the prayer meeting was about. Her statements infuriated the organization sponsoring the event. The organization secretary stated that, in fact, Mother Teresa did know the purpose of the prayer meeting as it had been explained to her by the auxiliary bishop of the Delhi archdiocese.<p></p><p></p>In another time, an incident such as this would have rallied Mother Teresa’s supporters. Instead, she not only antagonized non-Christians, but Christians as well. One church official went so far as to say that Mother Teresa, with her antiquated views on abortion and family planning, had become obsolete. She had, in fact, helped create a greater schism in a country already plagued by numerous divisions.<p></p><p></p>STEPPING ASIDE<p></p><p></p>On March 13, 1997, the Missionaries of Charity took a long-awaited step: choosing a successor to head their order. The announcement ended months of speculation not only about Mother Teresa’s future, but about who would succeed her. The discussions over the new leader had been deadlocked for weeks as the order struggled to find an acceptable replace-ment. Eventually the members were forced to turn to Pope John Paul II who offered a compromise: Mother Teresa would stay on as spiritual and titular head of the Missionaries of Charity, while Sister Nirmala, a 63-year-old member of the order would take over the day-to-day duties of the group. It was also decided that she would hold the post for six years when<p></p> 
136	MOTHER TERESA<p></p><p></p>the group would meet again to choose either a new head or reelect Sister Nirmala.<p></p><p></p>Despite the effort at compromise, the transition did not go smoothly. Within hours of Sister Nirmala’s appointment, Mother Teresa announced plans to create a number of new homes. Sister Nirmala did not object. She was by temperament timid, and decided to maintain a low profile, even bypassing the title of “Mother” for the time being. Mother Teresa acted as if she were still in charge, while giving her blessing to her successor.<p></p><p></p>Though her health was failing, Mother Teresa continued to travel, to raise funds, and visit many of the new homes that the Missionaries of Charity established. But in March 1996, she fell out of bed and broke her collarbone. Yet, by June, she was traveling again, though she fell once more, this time severely spraining her ankle. In the meantime, her mem-ory grew worse and lapses became more frequent.<p></p><p></p>In August 1996, Mother Teresa was once more admitted to the Wood-land’s Nursing Home in Calcutta. She was having trouble breathing and many believed that she was going to die. She rallied, though, and left the facility on September 6, against her doctors’ wishes. She then attended special services marking the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the Missionaries of Charity. But two weeks later, she was back in the hospital after having fallen down the stairs at the Motherhouse. More of her days were spent in bed suffering from severe back pain.<p></p><p></p>Finally, in January 1997, Mother Teresa announced her decision to re-sign as mother superior of the order; her health was too precarious, and even she seemed to realize that she could no longer battle her ailments as she once had. However, in May, she did travel to Rome where she met with the pope and then to the United States where she was awarded the Congressional Medal of Freedom in recognition for her work. She also made time to tour New York City’s the Bronx with Princess Diana.<p></p><p></p>The untimely death of Princess Diana three months later was one more loss to bear. Mother Teresa had become good friends with the young princess, often offering her advice. The two also talked of Mother Teresa’s work, and Princess Diana had made a point of visiting Nirmal Hriday when she came to India, years before. Mother Teresa’s remarks on the princess’ death were in fact her last public statements. On September 5, 1997, the eve of Diana’s funeral, Mother Teresa’s heart finally stopped. After a private service at the chapel of the Motherhouse, her body was transferred to a Missionary of Charity ambulance with the word “Mother” written across it, and taken to St. Thomas Church, which was used by the Loreto Sisters. Here, thousands of mourners crowded among the pews to pay their respects to the tiny nun. A week later, the Indian government<p></p> 
“THE MOST OBEDIENT WOMAN IN THE CHURCH” 137<p></p><p></p>held a state funeral for Mother Teresa. On September 13, her body was carried through the streets of Calcutta on the same gun carriage used to transport two of India’s greatest leaders and heroes: Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru. Thousands of mourners lined the streets as the carriage traveled to the Calcutta sports stadium where a state funeral mass was held; numerous dignitaries were in attendance to pay their respects. Af-terwards, in a private ceremony, with soldiers firing their guns in a last tribute, Mother Teresa was laid to rest beneath a plain stone slab on the grounds of the Motherhouse located at A.J.C. Bose Road. Here, she is not far from the people she served and helped.<p></p><p></p>THE MAKING OF A SAINT<p></p><p></p>Six years after her death, Mother Teresa was back in the news. In 2003, it was announced that John Paul II, to help commemorate his 25th an-niversary of his election to the papacy, would beatify Mother Teresa on October 19. The event marks the final step before canonization, or official sainthood. It was a remarkable process in that no one has ever been beat-ified in so short a time as Mother Teresa. Yet, Vatican officials worked rig-orously to treat her case as they would any other.<p></p><p></p>Even before her death, some officials in the Vatican thought she ought to be canonized without the usual investigation. Pope John Paul II even waived the usual five-year waiting period to see whether a candidate’s reputation for holiness is justified. For Father Brian Kolodiejchuk, the task ahead was even more daunting; he was charged with coordinating the team that eventually put together 67 volumes arguing that Mother Teresa met all the requirements for sainthood. In addition, the church lawyers held 14 tribunals all over the world to hear testimony from peo-ple who knew Mother Teresa well. Nearly all were friendly witnesses who had to answer 263 questions that were used as evidence that Mother Teresa had manifested the virtues required of a Roman Catholic saint: faith, hope, and charity, as well as humility, prudence, justice, fortitude, and temperance to an extraordinary degree. Mother Teresa also had her critics: three non-Catholics testified against her, among them Christo-pher Hitchens.<p></p><p></p>In the end, Father Kolodiejchuk’s team concluded that Mother Teresa’s willingness to work with those who were morally and financially corrupt was in keeping with her own philosophy: using ill-gotten money to do good for the poor and also provide spiritual benefits for the donors. As to her failure to take a more aggressive stance against institutionalized injus-tice, the team sided with Mother Teresa. They argued that her mission<p></p> 
138	MOTHER TERESA<p></p><p></p>was to help individuals and bear witness to the Divine presence in the world, not fight for social change.<p></p><p></p>As with all candidates for sainthood, the church required a divine sign in the form of a posthumous miracle. Many claims were submitted; the one chosen concerned a Hindu mother, Monika Besra, who came to the sisters suffering from a life-threatening stomach tumor. The sisters prayed to Mother Teresa for a cure and pressed a religious medal that she had touched to Besra’s abdomen. Five hours later, the tumor had completely disappeared.<p></p><p></p>The beatification ceremonies in Rome were only the beginning of a media and merchandising frenzy surrounding Mother Teresa’s eventual canonization. In Calcutta, Mother Teresa’s legacy was to be honored with an international festival of films. The event was a first; no saint in the his-tory of the Catholic Church has had an international festival of films held in their honor. Among the films scheduled to be shown were Malcolm Muggeridge’s Something Beautiful for God, two-time Emmy Award winner Anne Petrie’s Mother Teresa—Her Legacy, Japanese director Shigeki Chiba’s Mother Teresa and Her World, Anna & Folco Terzani’s Mother Teresa’s First Love, and Dominique LaPierre’s In the Name of God’s Poor. The controversial 1994 Hell’s Angel: Mother Teresa of Calcutta was also to be shown, but in the end was pulled.<p></p><p></p>In addition to the film festival, the Vatican issued special commemora-tive stamps of Mother Teresa. Factories churned out additional merchan-dise, including Mother Teresa rosaries, crucifixes, and key chains. According to one vendor, his factory is working full time to make 10,000 Mother Teresa rosaries, key chains, and other trinkets. A stage musical and an animated cartoon based on her life and works were to be presented as well. In one of the more bizarre, but also more historically familiar, ways of honoring a holy person, a display of Mother Teresa’s blood was planned.<p></p><p></p>Today, Mother Teresa’s thoughts can still be found in the more than 20 books she coauthored to offer spiritual advice and guidance to people. Her order continues to be active and hard at work. Both the sisters and the brothers continue to thrive, though not experiencing the rapid growth of homes and foundations that marked the last 25 years of Mother Teresa’s life. More than 3,000 volunteers come to Calcutta every year, hoping to make a difference at least for a little while.<p></p><p></p>At the same time, the Missionaries of Charity have shown themselves to be a little more worldly, as they successfully copyrighted the name of Mother Teresa in 2003. The nuns said they sought the rights to Mother Teresa’s name, the name of their order, and its rosary-encircled globe logo<p></p> 
“THE MOST OBEDIENT WOMAN IN THE CHURCH” 139<p></p><p></p>to prevent them from being exploited by commercial interests. It is diffi-cult to say what the future holds for the order; like many other religious orders, the changing climate of the times often forces changes if a reli-gious group hopes to survive. There may be changes in the way the com-munity lives or is administered. There may even be a subtle shift in how best to help the poor, but, as Sister Nirmala comes from a contemplative background—as opposed to a medical or social work emphasis—the di-rection of the Missionaries of Charity is carried out as Mother Teresa had originally envisioned it.<p></p><p></p>THE LEGACY OF MOTHER TERESA<p></p><p></p>When asked to explain the Missionaries of Charity, Mother Teresa once remarked, “We are first of all religious; we are not social workers, not teachers, not nurses or doctors, we are religious sisters. We serve Jesus in the poor.”14 With that statement, Mother Teresa made clear the mission of the order and to the best of her abilities lived her life following that simple premise.<p></p><p></p>Still, there is no question that for the last 20 years of her life Mother Teresa and her work were at times seriously misunderstood. She inspired many people not through powerful speeches or magnificent works but be-cause she exemplified a way, imperfect as it was at times, of using the power of love to heal and save. As journalist Mary Poplin pointed out, the key to understanding Mother Teresa and the Missionaries of Charity is the sacredness with which they treat all people and their humble way of carrying out their work. To the Missionaries of Charity, Jesus is present in everyone they meet whether it is a young volunteer from New Jersey or an old Muslim woman starved and half-eaten by rats and worms, or the de-formed infant just born and left in a garbage heap. Christ is present in ev-eryone, but most especially in the poorest of the poor. From the very beginning, Mother Teresa and her order reached out to treat each person they encountered as they would Jesus Christ. Thus, they performed each task for the benefit of the poor as they would do it for Christ. In other words, it is Jesus’ diapers they wash, his meals they prepare, his ailing body they tend, and his hand being held.<p></p><p></p>On closer inspection, Mother Teresa appeared a contradiction, a walk-ing paradox, and later, a woman out of step with the times. But that as-sessment dismisses her and her work much too easily. Mary Poplin, the journalist who volunteered for the Missionaries of Charity, tried to ex-plain her understanding of Mother Teresa:<p></p> 
140	MOTHER TERESA<p></p><p></p>Many writers have depicted Mother Teresa as someone who saw the poor and responded sympathetically to their needs. That is not quite the case. Mother Teresa served the poor not because they needed her but because God called her to the work. She was obedient to God’s call, not to her social con-science. She often remarked that if God had told her what was to happen after she picked up the first dying person off the Cal-cutta street, she would never have done it, for she would have been too afraid.15<p></p><p></p>Mother Teresa called herself “a pencil in God’s hand.” What she meant was that she was simply God’s instrument and she did only his bidding, re-lying on his providence to provide for her order and the poor. Part of her success lay in her ability to tap into and inspire a large number of volun-teers, many of them young men and women who needed help. Quite often, it was the more knowledgeable and qualified volunteers who had the most trouble working with and understanding Mother Teresa. But for many young people who had only high ideals but were not sure how to put those ideals into practice, Mother Teresa and her work were a good match. No matter if they stayed an hour, a week, or a year, they were al-ways welcomed. For in the time they stayed, these volunteers made a dif-ference to those around them and Mother Teresa was grateful for their gifts. For others, Mother Teresa was unique, not because of her work with the poor, but because for many people, she was doing what they wished to do. She was what they were not.<p></p><p></p>Her legacy is strong; at the time of her death, there were more than 4,000 sisters in the Missionaries of Charity, along with 400 brothers and thousands of others who have volunteered as Co-Workers, Lay Missionar-ies of Charity, and Missionaries of Charity Fathers. It is through these vol-unteers that Mother Teresa’s spirit lives on. Yet, Mother Teresa had her flaws as well: she was stubborn, difficult to work with, and demanding. Perhaps she needed those qualities to carry out the work to which she be-lieved God had called her. But Mother Teresa was also a woman who sang Happy Birthday to Jesus at Christmas, who regarded all life as holy, and who saw the face of God in the face of every human being she encoun-tered. For Mother Teresa, her works came not from the strength of her in-tellect, but of the great power and love she had in her heart.<p></p>

Chapter 7<p></p> <p></p> THE LONG PRISON YEARS:<p></p> <p></p> FRIENDS, FAMILY, AND<p></p> <p></p> GLOBAL SOLIDARITY<p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> After midnight on June 12, 1964, Mandela and his fellow African co-accused from the Rivonia Trial found themselves shackled and then flown on an old Dakota military transport plane to Robben Island. Alcatraz— Devil’s Island—Robben Island—the name was synonymous with repres-sion and punishment. Historically, colonial authorities had banished troublesome indigenous political prisoners to prison isles. In South Africa first the Dutch, then the British colonialists had used Robben Island, 8.7 miles (14 kilometers) off the coast of Cape Town, to incarcerate Afri-can resistance fighters. Some had tried to escape but very few survived the chilly, shark-infested waters.<p></p> <p></p> The prison discipline on Robben (“Seal” in Dutch) Island was harsh, even cruel. When the prisoners arrived, warder “batons rained down on us,” wrote Mandela’s friend Ahmed Kathrada. Most warders were Afrikaners who abused the prisoners with racist epithets such as “kaffir”: one bel-lowed “Dis die Eialnd. Hier julle gaan vrek” (This is the Island. Here you will die). Humiliations heaped upon humiliations: warders buried some prisoners up to their faces in sand and urinated on them, or forced them to strip and jump around. Absurd forms of racial discrimination perme-ated everything: Africans could have only tiny amounts of meat a week; officials somehow presumed they had no “biological” need for it given their “traditional” culture. They only received short pants, while Indian or Colored South Africans received long pants. They had to sleep on the hard floor, on thin mats. Robben Island, in the South Atlantic, can be very cold in winter and the prisoners lacked basic warmth.1<p></p>  
<p></p> <p></p> <p></p> 79<p></p>  
80	NELSON MANDELA<p></p> <p></p> Mandela’s cramped cell was no more than six feet square. He shared the political section of the jail with his co-accused from the Rivonia Trial: Govan Mbeki, Walter Sisulu, Ahmed Kathrada, Raymond Mhlaba, Elias Motsoaledi, and Andrew Mlangeni. Daily, the prisoners had to do forced labor with picks and shovels in a lime quarry, where in summer the blazing sun reflecting on the limestone permanently damaged Mandela’s eyes; yet it took three years for him to gain permission to wear sunglasses. The hard labor lasted 13 years, but it also toughened the prisoners’ resolve never to submit. The outdoor work invigorated Mandela. “It felt good to use all of one’s muscles, with the sun at one’s back.” On the daily march to the quarry, we “could see the dense brush and tall trees that covered our home, and smell the eucalyptus blossoms, spot the occasional springbok or kudu grazing in the distance.”2<p></p> Mandela refused to take jail lying down. His resistance took many forms: uniting, inspiring, and acting as a spokesperson for the other pris-oners; opposing racism and cruelty and demanding fair treatment; and communicating with the outside world, family, and friends.<p></p> <p></p> He fought for basic reforms of harsh prison conditions, no matter how small and no matter how long it took him, showing his relentless pursuit of justice, his stubbornness, and his commitment. On the very first day, confronted by an aggressive warder, Mandela stood his ground and refused to be intimidated, warning the official of legal action if he assaulted the prisoners. Mandela demanded long pants; eventually he won but refused to accept them unless all other prisoners received them. Again, his per-sistence succeeded. In the quarry, the prisoners faced unrealistic work quotas, but Mandela comforted and advised his comrades. “Look, don’t be terrorized by these demands,” he told them, “work at your own pace.” Again, his persistence succeeded.3<p></p> <p></p> The prisoners were far from passive, their resistance multifaceted. There were hunger strikes, although this tactic was of limited effective-ness given the island’s isolation from the mass media, something that Mandela understood; but even so, he felt he had to go along with his comrades. There were complaints against poor conditions and brutal warders. One warder, sporting a swastika tattoo, sought to make life a misery for the prisoners with incessant intimidation and charges. In response, Mandela relayed to the visiting Helen Suzman, one of the very few South African parliamentarians to take any interest in their wel-fare, the prisoners’ demands: better and equal food and clothing; study facilities; the right to newspapers; and an end to this warder’s harsh reign. For once, there was action; Suzman complained to the government, and Mandela soon saw the warden transferred.4<p></p>  
THE LONG PRISON YEARS	81
<p></p> Robben Island mirrored the racism of apartheid, but the prisoners cun-ningly transformed the bleak jail into an unwitting “university of the strug-gle.” At first the Rivonia prisoners, and then later on more and more ANC and MK prisoners, including an influx of militant youth after the 1976 Soweto Revolt, all took educational courses to develop their technical skills and focus their minds. Encouraged by Mandela, many took the opportunity to gain degrees or high school diplomas through external courses. How-ever, many books and certain subjects, such as political science, remained prohibited.<p></p> <p></p> The prisoners also constructed their own elaborate forms of political education, in which Mandela was prominent as a teacher, writing mes-sages in the white sand of the island and leading discussions. This resis-tance strengthened their unity and allowed a small measure of control over their lives; after a while, prison authorities abandoned efforts to pre-vent them from talking and let the discussions continue.5<p></p> <p></p> Among the other underground leaders who joined the Rivonia pris-oners was Mac Maharaj, who arrived six months after Mandela. Maharaj probably suffered the most physical torture of all the prisoners; before trial, he had refused to talk to his tormentors, and on “The Island,” he remained defiant. He vividly recalls how “Madiba” remained a leader of the nation despite being in prison. Mandela exercised a curious form of authority over his fellow prisoners: Maharaj never knew Mandela to give an order, but invariably Maharaj would carry out the wishes of Madiba, who always would lead by example.6<p></p> <p></p> “The Island” (as it became known among the prisoners) could be a vio-lent place. There were terrible beatings by warders of some prisoners, such as the poet and organizer of sporting boycotts of apartheid, Dennis Brutus, dumped in a cell one night covered with bruises and with a gunshot wound from police, inflicted not long before and still infected. The warders also sought to turn the violence of the ordinary convicts incarcerated on the island against the Rivonia prisoners, of whom they were contemptuous. In this situation, Mandela’s courage, leadership, and diplomatic skills came into play as he initiated efforts to bridge the gap between the different categories of prisoners and between prisoners and jailers. Initial friction with the common law prisoners gradually gave way to shared interests. Warders slowly and grudgingly began to acknowledge the humanity of all the prisoners. They showed Mandela special respect, perhaps due to his growing international reputation, or his royal ancestry, or simply because of his huge physical stature and proud bearing.<p></p> <p></p> Mandela worked hard to try to develop a united front with PAC and other political prisoners. This was not easy given political rivalries. The<p></p>  
82	NELSON MANDELA<p></p> <p></p> PAC, whose members had arrived on the Island first, seemed to resent the growing presence of ANC prisoners. However, Mandela angled persis-tently to find common ground and at times was able to strengthen unity between the different organizations. In 1967, he was able to get PAC lead-ers to cosign a petition for better treatment of all prisoners.<p></p> <p></p> The mutual support of the prisoners for each other was essential to their survival. On the Island, they stealthily reproduced their outside political structures as best they could. Mandela headed the ANC’s inter-nal leadership on the Island, the High Command, or High Organ, consist-ing of those who had been members of the legal ANC National Executive Committee. “Kathy” (Kathrada), the youngest, built channels of com-munication with the different sections of prisoners. Walter Sisulu was the “beloved father” whom the others found “compassionate and always helpful.” Binding them all together, and regarded by the others as their spokesperson, was Mandela.7<p></p> <p></p> Mandela’s character shines through in his relations with the other prisoners. For example, Eddie Daniels was a member of a quite different political organization, the Liberal Party, from a Colored working-class background, and had never met Mandela before coming to the Island. Looking back on their years together in confinement, Daniels stresses Mandela’s integrity, foresight, compassion, tolerance, and leadership. He could be humorous, kind, and humble. Once, when Daniels was ill, Man-dela personally cleaned the sick man’s toilet bucket. He shared his per-sonal letters with Daniels. Mandela would delight in calling his comrades by nicknames; it was, recalled Maharaj, a subtle way of exercising his authority. Maharaj was “Neef” (nephew), and he called Mandela “Oom” (uncle). Yet Mandela let Daniels (and very few others) call him by his private circumcision name, Dalibhunga.8<p></p> <p></p> If, with his Thembu royal bearing, Mandela sometimes could be a little aloof, then he always took time in a fatherly way to welcome individual prisoners and discuss their problems. On Robben Island, Daniels was the lone member of the Liberal Party, already a spent force in South African politics, but Mandela insisted on treating him as an important equal. Daniels was amazed that a person of such stature as Mandela would deign to make friends with him. In prison, after coming back from important meetings, Mandela would report to the ANC and then, to protect Dan-iels’s political integrity—as PAC members had accused Daniels of “being ANC”—he would report to him separately. Mandela was, he emphasizes, “a magnanimous man; where others ignored me—and I didn’t know anyone—he was just that type of person who would come forward and embrace you and make you feel good, and extend the hand of friendship.”<p></p>  
THE LONG PRISON YEARS	83
<p></p> In part, this approach aimed to build nonracialism, to create a culture of survival on the island, and to knit the prisoners together like a family. Although political differences arose, and Mandela could be very stubborn in sticking to his beliefs, he would always say “let us work together; let us not fight one another.” In this regard, states Daniels, Mandela was “a great unifier; he was never boastful, never threw his weight around.”9<p></p> <p></p> Michael Dingake was an ANC activist also jailed on Robben Island. He saw Mandela as the “most tireless participant” in the prisoners’ dis-cussions and for whom every day saw a busy routine of meetings with fellow inmates. Much of this routine involved asking about other people’s welfare and complaints to such an extent that it seemed to Dingake (and other fellow Islanders, such as Kathrada) that Mandela seemed to care more for his compatriots than his own health. By insisting on their right to make complaints and by representing their interests before the prisoner authorities, Mandela empowered prisoners to present their own demands. Dingake observed Mandela’s slow, purposeful style of speaking, his man-ner of “stressing every word, and every syllable he uttered.” Mandela was a “shrewd tactician” whose close attention to detail and extensive legal experience helped blunt some of the worst excesses of cruelty carried out by prisoner officers. He would always go straight to the top with com-plaints about abusive treatment of the prisoners, demanding justice; in many ways, he simply wore down the bureaucracy such that it gradually conceded their rights. Mandela, a forceful and well-informed debater, also taught Dingake to see the two sides of a question.10<p></p> <p></p> Some differences related to tactics. Mandela was pragmatic. He once shocked Daniels by musing that one day they might well have to make use of the hated Population Registration Act of the apartheid regime. Yet here, Mandela’s concern was simply to ensure representation of everyone. When some prisoners said that someday they would “take care” of a noto-riously cruel warder, Mandela said, “No, we may have to use him.” On another occasion, Mandela encouraged fellow political prisoner Andimba Toivo ja Toivo (leader of the ANC’s sister movement in the neighbor-ing country of Namibia, SWAPO [South West African People’s Orga-nization]), not to simply walk away from wardens and opponents but to engage with them. Behind this direct or diplomatic approach to warders was pragmatism and common decency; hostility, Mandela reasoned, was self-defeating. He also had enormous self-control, which fellow prisoner and confidante Maharaj argues lay in Mandela’s deep introspection and self-criticism that enabled him to think clearly and weigh all sides to an argument. Mandela also decided to learn Afrikaans, arguing it was impor-tant to know one’s enemy. Why not try to educate everyone, even your<p></p>  
84	NELSON MANDELA<p></p> <p></p> enemies, he reasoned? Again, Mandela succeeded: in time, some of the warders came to respect him, and treat him with deference.11<p></p> One of the sharpest, if still comradely ideological tussles on Robben Island was that between Mandela and Govan Mbeki, father of Thabo Mbeki (who became South African president in 1999). One of their argu-ments was over the question of cooperation with apartheid-backed insti-tutions such as the Bantustans, which Mbeki steadfastly opposed. Another was the relationship between the ANC and Communist Party. They also disagreed over whether national liberation would lead to capitalism or to socialism. Here there are clues to the policies Mandela would adopt in later decades.12<p></p> <p></p> Survival in such a harsh prison required not just strength, endurance, and enormous willpower, but also creativity. To communicate, the politi-cal prisoners invented ingenious ruses. They collected empty matchboxes discarded by the warders, constructed false bottoms, and secreted inside them tiny written, coded messages, often written on toilet paper in milk that was normally invisible but legible if treated with the disinfectant used to clean their cells. They also forged ties with the general prison-ers who delivered food, and developed a secret communication system by leaving notes under dirty dishes in the kitchen, or hidden under the rim of toilet bowls in ablutions shared by prisoners from different sec-tions. Visitors and released prisoners also transmitted messages on their behalf: Maharaj hollowed out his study books and files to smuggle out the entire manuscript of Mandela’s autobiography, secretly written in the 1970s. Another Mandela writing that Maharaj successfully hid from prison authorities was an essay written in 1976 on the future of the coun-try. In the essay, Mandela emphasized that the major issue confronting the liberation movement was unity, something he spent much time practicing on Robben Island.13<p></p> <p></p> The isolated prisoners particularly treasured news and education. “Newspapers,” writes Mandela, “were more valuable to political prison-ers than gold or diamonds, more hungered for than food or tobacco; they were the most precious contraband on Robben Island.” They fought con-stantly for the right to have newspapers and, when refused, arranged for copies to be smuggled. They scavenged newspapers discarded by the ward-ers. For six months, they had access to a daily newspaper after befriend-ing, and then outwitting, an elderly night warder. On another occasion, a prisoner mischievously lifted a newspaper from the briefcase of a visiting clergyman as he prayed with eyes closed. Once, warders caught Mandela with a newspaper and he spent three days in isolation without meals. But with persistence, the prisoners secured slight improvements: from 1969,<p></p>  
THE LONG PRISON YEARS	85
<p></p> film showings; in 1975, their first hot showers; from 1980 access to news-papers; and from 1982 visits from children.14<p></p> The prisoners tried singing political songs in Xhosa to lighten their work, but some warders understood Xhosa, and banned singing—as well as whistling. Another important distraction became gardening. Their courtyard garden was no more than a modest patch of green in the grim, gray prison, but it gave the prisoners much needed relief from stress; it also provided tomatoes, chilies, onions, and melons. Mandela, wrote Kath-rada to family friend Tom Vassen in 1975, had become “fanatical” about the garden; it was “Nelson’s baby.” The arrival in the garden of a chame-leon captured the prisoners’ attention and induced much debate over the peculiar nature of the creature. At other times, they turned repeatedly to discuss such curious topics as whether the tiger was native to Africa, all serving to focus their minds and avoid depression or despair.15<p></p> <p></p> The prisoners experimented with other forms of relaxation to get their minds off their captivity. They greatly appreciated a smuggled copy of the works of Shakespeare, each of them choosing memorable lines of the Bard as their personal motto. Mandela selected a passage from the drama Julius Caesar that included<p></p> <p></p> Cowards die many times before their deaths; The valiant never taste of death but once. . . .<p></p> <p></p> In 1975, the prisoners even staged their own play, Sophocles’ Antigone, in which Mandela played the regal character of Creon, a role that his friend Kathrada wryly comments made up for his dethronement as island domino champion of 1973.16<p></p> <p></p> Sport and games provided valuable recreation to reduce tension and pass the time. At first, prison authorities refused to “play ball” and denied them the freedom to play sport. However, Mandela persistently urged the International Red Cross to lobby for sports facilities, eventually granted in the mid-1970s, when volleyball equipment and a ping-pong table appeared. The prisoners developed a sophisticated sports series, including soccer and rugby tournaments. Later they built their own tennis court in the prison courtyard. Mandela did not mind that his backhand was weaker than his forearm shots; he enjoyed the relaxation. He played ten-nis and chess with Andimba Toivo ja Toivo, who many years later jested that Mandela always won and took hours to make a single chess move.<p></p> <p></p> Even more than games, physical fitness was vital for well-being in a forced labor prison. In the early morning, Mandela would jog around his cell and do dozens of push-ups and sit-ups. In 1982, when he shared<p></p>  
86	NELSON MANDELA<p></p> <p></p> accommodation with other prisoners, he would rise at 3 A.M. and run around the cell for an hour, and then do aerobics and weightlifting, until finally his cellmates objected to being awakened in the middle of the night.<p></p> <p></p> Despite his spirited resistance, the years on Robben Island hurt Mandela in various ways. His health deteriorated, and the psychological pressure was intense. He was distraught at the terrible news of the death of his mother and his son, Thembi. Denied permission to attend his own son’s funeral, Mandela kept his grief to himself, letting only his old friend, Walter Sisulu, console him.17<p></p> <p></p> The human isolation could be crushing. For the first years, authori-ties allowed Mandela only one visitor and one letter (of up to only 500 words) every six months, and prison authorities made visits very difficult for Winnie. They censored and withheld letters, but these remained a major source of hope.<p></p> <p></p> Mandela cherished letters, even those arriving in tatters or blacked out by the censors: “A letter was like the summer rain that could make even the desert bloom.” Visits were brief—only 30 minutes long—and with no physical contact; Mandela and Winnie had to shout at each other through thickened, opaque glass: “We had to conduct our relationship at a distance under the eyes of people we despised.” It would not be until 1984 that they would have their first contact visit. To circumvent the restrictions on discussing politics, the couple invented a clever code using names only they understood: to ask about the ANC in exile, he would ask, “How is the church?” But due to police harassment and Winnie’s own banning orders, he had to wait two years for her next visit. Neverthe-less, Winnie worked hard, dressing elegantly and overcoming obstacles, to make every visit special for him. In a letter of November 22, 1979, he wrote to her that on a recent visit she had looked “really wonderful . . .<p></p> <p></p> very much like the woman I married. . . . I felt like singing, even if just to say Hallelujah!” Yet Mandela could also see the strain on Winnie. Regu-lations forced her to visit only via air travel, which drained her savings. When police harassment saw her lose her job as a social worker, mak-ing the financial survival of the family perilous, Mandela despaired: “My powerlessness gnawed at me.”18<p></p> <p></p> Family photographs were equally precious. He wrote intimately to Win-nie in 1976 that he dusted her photograph each day, even touching “your nose with mine to recapture the electric current that used to flush through my blood whenever I did so.” Three years later, in a similar letter, he told her he would have fallen apart years ago without her love and letters, and that dusting the family photos in his prison cell eased the longing. In<p></p>  
THE LONG PRISON YEARS	87
<p></p> a letter to daughter Zeni in 1977 he told her, “It’s family photos, letters and family visits that keep on reminding me of the happy days when we were together, that makes life sweet and that fills the heart with hope and expectation.”19<p></p> <p></p> However, security police often refused to deliver Mandela’s letters, even to his children. His letters to them exhibit a gnawing worry for their welfare, the deep pain of a father helplessly unable to be with his fam-ily. In 1970, knowing letters he had sent in 1969 had not arrived and that Winnie too was in jail, he wrote to the children that letters were a “means of passing on to you my warmest love,” they helped “calm down the shooting pains that hit me when I think of you.” Authorities forbade children under 18 from visiting, and they denied him permission to see his grandchildren. Years later, Mandela and Kathrada both would rue that what they missed most of all on the island was children.20<p></p> <p></p> In the early years of his jail sentence, the mass media both inside South Africa and overseas largely forgot Mandela. The role of his wife therefore became vital to his survival and future prospects. South African journal-ist Benjamin Pogrund points out that “Winnie never gave up, and went on fighting to keep her husband’s name alive . . . with a personal passion, standing up to the Security Police to show her contempt for them and the system they enforced.” Her courage was never in doubt; she confronted armed police and berated them, but it came with a terrible cost.21<p></p> <p></p> Arrested in 1962 and again in May 1969 without charge, Winnie Mandela was in solitary confinement for 18 months, denied bail and visi-tors, and brutally interrogated. On release, a massive overkill of heavily armed police rearrested and then banished her to the remote rural town of Brandfort for five years. Harassment by security forces was constant. She could not even go to church without a permit, and the only visitors allowed were a doctor and lawyer; a priest had to stay outside to give her communion. Friends such as Helen Joseph, who brought her food, faced arrest. Security police went to such absurd lengths as confiscating her bedspread, as it was in ANC colors—green, yellow, and black; 26 mem-bers of the U.S. Congress got together to send her a Pennsylvanian quilt as a replacement. Terrorists attacked the family home. In 1975, Winnie briefly resumed open political activity after her bans expired, but in a while she again was banned and sent into internal exile. Nelson Mandela tried to defend her from afar, using every legal means he could as a pris-oner, employing lawyers to try to protect the family. Winnie too resisted. She broke out of isolation by interacting with local people in the poverty-stricken ghetto, helping them organize a crèche and a medical first aid program. Like her distant husband, she also developed a garden.22<p></p>  
88	NELSON MANDELA<p></p> <p></p> The government interpreted Winnie Mandela’s banning to extend to everyone in the house, so even her tiny daughter Zindzi could not have friends to visit. To avoid harassment, she sent her daughters to a Catholic boarding school in the nearby country of Swaziland, but the victimization continued as security police made a point of arresting Winnie whenever the children were due to return home at vacation. Her banning orders also meant Winnie could not enter her daughters’ schools or speak with their teachers. Her isolation was complete, and the harsh treatment she endured from a police interrogator for seven days and seven nights, she recalls, “taught me how to hate.” Explaining to her children the meaning of apartheid was painful: when six-year old Zindzi asked why her father was in jail, but not the black police officer next door, she had to clarify that in a sick society it is right for a just person to go to prison.23<p></p> <p></p> These traumatic experiences, so typical of apartheid society, made Win-nie Mandela very defensive and suspicious. She fought racial hatred with defiance and began to develop her own political following. However, her efforts to build a protective cordon around her family in the form of the “Mandela Football Club,” a group of local township youth who acted as bodyguards, backfired tragically when at the end of 1989 the gang, regard-ing anyone who refused to join as sell-outs, was involved in the death of a youth on her premises. Mandela was distraught and the events would have momentous impact.24<p></p> <p></p> For Nelson Mandela visits were vital to his well-being, yet the govern-ment played politics with whom they allowed to visit. Well-wishers or political supporters often could not enter the jail, while unsympathetic conservative outsiders, such as British and Australian journalists in 1964 and 1973, and an American lawyer in 1965, were able to visit and write innocuous press reports on the prison.<p></p> <p></p> Family and friends remained devoted. Family physician and children’s guardian Nthatho Motlana was another lifeline to the outside world. During a short, one-hour visit permitted in 1976, he found Mandela largely unchanged and unbowed, with “absolute dignity, a grand Xhosa chief! Extremely fit, mentally and physically” although his exercise was restricted: “even boxing was not allowed and he was a boxer himself!” In time, however, conditions improved somewhat, particularly when the government began to see in Mandela a possible way out of the deepening crisis in which they found themselves. By 1985, his wife was seeing him once a month.25<p></p> <p></p> Outside Mandela’s dreary prison walls, momentous changes were in the air. Apartheid had acted as a brake on socioeconomic development,<p></p>  
THE LONG PRISON YEARS	89
<p></p> greatly reducing black consumption and acquisition of skills, just as the South African economy saw deep structural changes, and the glaring contradiction between rigid racial and settlement policies and economic demands was accentuating the deep crisis; the currency plummeted.<p></p> <p></p> The peoples of South Africa faced a range of other frustrations. The 1970 Bantu Homelands Citizens Act effectively denied South African citizenship to Africans forced to become “citizens” of imposed “home-lands” that were technically made “independent” states but were recog-nized by no countries in the world and completely under the thumb of Pretoria. Culture, heritage, and education also suffered under the impact of apartheid policies and in the face of international sanctions and sports boycotts. Censorship was stifling, with television only introduced in the 1970s. The stifling social atmosphere exacerbated political tensions.<p></p> <p></p> Ever-growing internal resistance to, and international condemna-tion of, apartheid matched the steadfast resolution of the prisoners. The ANC’s banning had driven it deep underground. Yet although the organi-zation was now illegal—the state even made it illegal to display his photo or quote his writings—this could not stop the hundreds of thousands of people who had supported Congress from expressing their support in dif-ferent ways.<p></p> <p></p> With the ANC banned, new opposition forces emerged. Black Con-sciousness, led by charismatic student leader Steve Biko, took off in the late 1960s. Then in 1972–1973, the black labor movement came to life again in a sudden, massive strike wave. Things were on the boil and with a rigid, inflexible, and intolerant government at the helm of state, the country finally exploded in 1976, ignited by student protests in Soweto.<p></p> <p></p> Although the 1976 protests were quashed by harsh measures from the state security forces that saw many casualties, popular resistance reemerged in the 1980s. This coalesced around vibrant, new mass orga-nizations. The United Democratic Front (UDF, formed in 1983), was a very wide coalition of more than 600 community, labor, sport, and church organizations. The Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU, formed in 1985), with its largest affiliate, the National Union of Mine-workers (1982), led by ex-student activist Cyril Ramaphosa, grew rapidly and challenged the previously monolithic economic domination of the apartheid state. Many church leaders, such as Archbishop Desmond Tutu, lent their weight to popular protests. All across the country these diverse groups spoke out loudly and their support grew rapidly, with many people aligning themselves with the ideas of the ANC exemplified in the Free-dom Charter. One of their major demands was the release of Mandela and all political prisoners.<p></p>  
90	NELSON MANDELA<p></p> <p></p> Inspiration and hope also came to Mandela from overseas. The ANC saw four pillars to its struggle: mass-scale political action, the armed struggle, underground organization, and international solidarity. Increasingly, the latter force began to affect South Africa. Fellow Robben Island inmate Indres Naidoo recalls that the news that the names of their leaders such as Mandela and Sisulu were becoming famous internationally particularly cheered the prisoners.26<p></p> <p></p> Around the world, the anti-apartheid movement became truly global, uniting student, church, labor, and political groups with specifically anti-apartheid organizations in which exiled South Africans often played a large part. Some governments, notably those in India, Scandinavia, and Eastern Europe, provided material aid to the ANC in exile. Many governments broadly implemented UN anti-apartheid resolutions, and more countries recognized the ANC than South Africa. However, it took decades to convince major Western powers, notably Britain and the United States and their transnational corporations, effectively to boycott Pretoria, which used many loopholes—trade in uranium, gold, arms, and oil, and “mercenary” sports teams—to try to boost its flagging status.<p></p> <p></p> With some governments slow to act, the anti-apartheid movement developed its own forms of support, adopting “people’s sanctions.” Orga-nizations such as the London-based International Defence and Aid Fund (IDAF) channeled valuable material resources to political prisoners, their families, and their lawyers; the work of IDAF, noted Mandela in 1992, was “absolutely vital” and a “morale booster.”27<p></p> <p></p> Also vital to the overall success of the movement of solidarity was the situation in the United States. Here there was a very broad range of anti-apartheid forces, such as the American Committee on Africa (which networked disinvestment campaigns), the Africa Fund (focusing on educa-tion and aid), the Congressional Black Caucus, TransAfrica, and the Free South African Movement, plus numerous federal and local labor, church, and student protest groups. This extensive movement created “new spaces in churches, campuses, stockholders meetings, entertainment and sports venues, city councils, and Congressional subcommittees to broaden sup-port for the sanctions that bypassed state and corporate decision makers and exerted direct pressure on South Africa.” If the American movement could ignite financial sanctions against the apartheid regime, then per-haps this would tip the balance in favor of change.28<p></p> <p></p> By the 1980s, the anti-apartheid movements in many countries were able to coordinate global “weeks of protest.” Many churches joined in. There were vigorous public boycotts of companies making money out of apartheid, notably oil giant Shell and those trading in South African<p></p>  
THE LONG PRISON YEARS	91
<p></p> products such as wine, fish, and gold kruggerand coins. More and more companies began to disinvest, some adopting “codes of conduct,” such as the Sullivan Principles developed by the American businessperson Leon Sullivan, which, if they had limited effect, at least encouraged other corporations to divest.<p></p> <p></p> At the same time, sporting sanctions hit the white South African com-munity hard. This was particularly so when imposed by countries such as New Zealand and Australia, which shared tournaments of sports such as rugby that were popular among Afrikaners. More significantly, financial sanctions had a deep impact and helped modify the views of white South Africans. In particular, the U.S. Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986, which saw President Reagan’s support for Pretoria finally overrid-den by Congress, and the refusal of U.S. banks to roll over South African loans, made sanctions a major force, eventually dragging Pretoria to the negotiating table.<p></p> <p></p> A strong focus of this global anti-apartheid movement was the call for Nelson Mandela’s release. By the 1980s, he had become a celebrated international prisoner of conscience and the most prominent opponent of apartheid. The British Commonwealth set up the Eminent Persons’ Group, led by former Prime Ministers Malcolm Fraser of Australia and Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria. In February 1986, they met with Mandela in jail, who convinced them of his sincerity for peaceful change, but they also concluded that the South African government did not intend to negotiate in good faith.29<p></p> <p></p> Throughout this period, many organizations bestowed upon Mandela numerous awards and honors, the number and status of which grew with time and added to pressure for his release. One of the first honors was as early as 1964, when the Students’ Union of University College, London, elected him Honorary President. In 1973, a scientist who discovered a nuclear particle at the University of Leeds named it the Mandela Particle. India, the first country to impose sanctions on South Africa, awarded Mandela the Jawaharlal Nehru Award for International Understanding. By 1982, more than 2,000 mayors in 54 countries had signed a petition for his release. In 1983, the New York City square in front of South Africa’s United Nations mission became “Nelson and Winnie Mandela Plaza.” Numerous universities conferred honorary doctorates. A hit record in 1984 was “Free Nelson Mandela” by British pop group Special AKA. In the same year, the U.S. Senate approved a resolution calling for Mande-la’s release. Archbishop Trevor Huddleston, Mandela’s old friend from Sophiatown and now leader of the British Anti-Apartheid Movement, presented on international petition of 50,000 signatures to the UN.<p></p>  
92	NELSON MANDELA<p></p> <p></p> The anti-apartheid movement developed other effective techniques to expose apartheid; it built its own media with newsletters, cartoons, and posters. It adopted diverse tactics, including pickets, lobbying, consumer boycotts, industrial action, sports disruption, mass rallies, and concerts. In 1988, many worldwide events commemorated Mandela’s 70th birthday: in June, a massive crowd of 72,000 packed Wembley Stadium in London for a rock concert, singing and chanting “Free Nelson Mandela” along with a galaxy of world artists including Whitney Houston and Harry Belafonte. Winnie Mandela sent a message, saying it had given South Africans renewed hope that “the whole world is with us in our struggle.” Ahmed Kathrada, still in jail, mused in a letter to friends that apart from Christmas, he could not recall “any person in history whose birthday has been so widely celebrated as Nelson’s.” Popular anti-apartheid feature films such as Cry Freedom and several documentaries on Mandela raised consciousness about apartheid and his fate. Writers, artists, cartoonists, and musicians from Bob Marley to Stevie Wonder inspired thousands of youth with their anti-apartheid lyrics. Star performers, massive rock con-certs, and public debate helped sway the global mass media, which almost nightly featured TV pictures of police dogs and sjambok whips tearing into defenseless people in South African streets, finally destroying the apart-heid regime’s last shreds of credibility.30<p></p> <p></p> By the late 1980s, therefore, widespread global protests had thoroughly tainted apartheid South Africa with international pariah status, resulting in international sanctions and disinvestment that destabilized the econ-omy and disrupted the regime’s tight hold on power.<p></p> <p></p> In the meantime, MK, the military wing that Mandela had founded, continued to operate from exile in the nearby African “front line states,” which the South African government repeatedly tried to destabilize with military attacks and “dirty tricks.” South African spies assassinated Man-dela’s old friend, the Jewish journalist Ruth First, with a parcel bomb sent to her office in neighboring Mozambique. MK forces were relatively small and poorly armed, but they provided a concrete symbol of resistance. Word of their exploits reaching the prisoners lifted their spirits: “We were very excited,” wrote Mandela, to see MK grow into a people’s army and attack strongholds of the apartheid regime such as the oil refinery Sasol.31<p></p> <p></p> With all this turbulence and with international sanctions starting to bite, sectors of white South African society became willing to negotiate. White businesspeople began to visit African countries such as Zambia and Senegal for preliminary talks with the ANC in exile, which had become a virtual government-in-waiting. Inside his prison walls, Mandela increas-ingly resembled a president-in-waiting.<p></p>  
THE LONG PRISON YEARS	93
<p></p> By the mid-1980s, Mandela occupied a rather odd position; the gov-ernment would not release him, yet without him, they could not hope to resolve the deep political-economic crises wracking the country. There were moves to test his willingness to accept a conditional release; his rela-tive Kaiser Matanzima, now an open accomplice of the apartheid system as a Bantustan chief, offered to host Mandela in the Transkei if he stayed there, out of the way. Mandela refused on principle. In February 1985, South African President P. W. Botha offered conditional release if Man-dela renounced violence. Mandela retorted that only free persons can negotiate, and reminded Botha that he still had not even accorded him the status of political prisoner. Mandela’s daughter Zindzi read a defiant and moving message from her father to a packed crowd in Orlando Foot-ball Stadium in Soweto in which he refused to separate his freedom from that of his people.<p></p> <p></p> I cannot sell my birthright, nor am I prepared to sell the birth-right of the people to be free. . . . What freedom am I being offered while the organization of the people remains banned?<p></p> <p></p> . . . What freedom am I being offered to live my life . . . with my dear wife who remains in banishment? . . . I cannot and will not give any undertaking at a time when I and you, the people, are not free. Your freedom and mine cannot be sepa-rated. . . . Only free men can negotiate. Prisoners cannot. . . .<p></p> <p></p> I will return.32<p></p> <p></p> Despite this deadlock, there were subtle signs of change. The nature of Mandela’s prison accommodation had been changing for the better. In 1982, the government had moved him and other key leaders from Robben Island to Pollsmoor Prison on the mainland near Cape Town. In 1985, he was isolated even from these close friends, given three rooms on a differ-ent floor, and largely prevented from speaking to them.<p></p> <p></p> This separation from the other prisoners and the resultant solitude led Mandela to decide that he now had an opportunity to initiate secret talks with the government. These he began tentatively in 1985, and they gathered pace in 1988, but at first led nowhere mainly because the dog-matic P. W. Botha remained in power. Botha pulled back from an excel-lent opportunity for compromise, instead launching destabilizing military attacks on neighboring countries and maintaining a state of emergency inside South Africa that tolerated no real freedom of dissent.<p></p> <p></p> Mandela therefore remained a prisoner as the years dragged on. In 1988, he contracted tuberculosis, and authorities in December of that<p></p>  
94	NELSON MANDELA<p></p> <p></p> year transferred him once more, this time to Victor Verster Prison near the town of Paarl, 40 minutes northeast of Cape Town. All of a sudden, Mandela was in very different surroundings: a warden’s bungalow com-plete with “royal trimmings” such as thick carpets and expensive furni-ture, white wardens acting virtually as servants, bodyguards, a swimming pool, and a fax machine. Yet “stripped of all these fineries,” observed Kathrada at the time, Mandela was “still a prisoner.”33<p></p> <p></p> In trying to find a negotiated solution, Mandela was in a difficult, com-plex position. There was political stalemate with neither side able to defeat the other, so he had decided it was time to press for negotiations, but only if the government was willing to renounce violence, free political prison-ers, lift the ban on the ANC, and permit open political activity. At first, he still was cut off from both the internal anti-apartheid resistance and the ANC in exile, and therefore unable properly to consult with them. It was, noted biographer Anthony Sampson, “the loneliest stretch in Mandela’s ordeal.” At first his close comrades—Sisulu and Kathrada—were skeptical of talks, with Oliver Tambo in exile and the UDF inside the country even more so, concerned that the government might be manipulating him. Yet, they appreciated that, given Mandela’s stubbornness, they could hardly stop him. Gradually, however, he was allowed to contact the ANC and became more accessible; for his birthday in July 1989, he was able to have a full family reunion as well as a meeting with Sisulu and Kathrada.34<p></p> <p></p> Mandela put his whole life’s reputation clearly on the line in agreeing to talk to a regime still launching bloody assaults on its own people and still regarded internationally as a pariah state. It was a bold, seemingly risky, move. In March 1989, Mandela drew up a detailed memorandum to try to break the political bottleneck. Botha had suffered a stroke and had begun to withdraw from official duties, but finally met Mandela in July. The talks were inconclusive and the following month Botha resigned as president, replaced by F. W. de Klerk, previously a hard-line supporter of apartheid, but starting to show signs of compromise. In August, the ANC in exile and its supporters adopted the Harare Declaration, which while remaining firm to its historic principles, opened the door to a negotiated settlement. Mandela had seen and approved the document in advance, and inside the country UDF structures, now organized as the Mass Demo-cratic Movement, supported the move. De Klerk and Mandela finally met in December 1989 amid rumors of his possible release; his old Robben Island friends, Sisulu and Kathrada, had already left prison in October.<p></p> <p></p> The experience of trials and prison made Mandela even more con-cerned with unity. His incarceration for 27 long years had important political effects, most notably preventing ANC leaders from negotiating<p></p>  
THE LONG PRISON YEARS	95
<p></p> with a government that became increasingly extreme in its policies. On the other hand, by bringing the anti-apartheid leaders together, jail expe-rience ironically enhanced their unity and dedication to their ideals. Nevertheless, although Mandela and his comrades never wavered in their unwillingness to compromise over the evil of apartheid, the long years of imprisonment served to blunt some of their earlier, more radical social goals and to some extent distanced them from those inside the country committed to changing the entire political and economic system upon which apartheid rested.<p></p> <p></p> Any form of imprisonment, of course, aims to stifle prisoner rebellious-ness, and Mandela was well aware of its impact. Eddie Daniels, when he met Mandela briefly outside Pollsmoor, remarked how beautiful the prison looked from the outside, with its flowers. Mandela shot back: “Danie, a prison is like a grave, beautiful outside but with decaying humanity inside.” However, as Daniels points out, Mandela was always a person open to compromise. Mandela used his great diplomatic and human skills not only to unify the movement but also to chart an alternative, negoti-ated route out of the chaos and violence that ever more enveloped South Africa in the 1980s.35<p></p> <p></p> Despite the traumas of 27 years in prison, Nelson Mandela maintained his commitment to principle; he refused freedom if other political pris-oners remained in jail, or if the ANC and its allies remained banned; democracy had to come. By 1989, he was in close touch with not only the government but also the ANC exile leadership and the ANC under-ground. Mandela and other ANC leaders could finally see some kind of change on the way; the endgame of apartheid was beginning, but it would be an unknown, difficult, and perilous final path to freedom.36<p></p> <p></p> NOTES<p></p> <p></p> 1.

<p></p> <p></p> Chapter 8<p></p> <p></p> FREE AT LAST: RELEASE AND TRANSITION TO DEMOCRACY<p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> Free at last! Widespread public manifestations of joy and hope swept the country on Nelson Mandela’s release from captivity on February 11, 1990. As he walked hand in hand with Winnie through the gates of Victor Verster prison, he realized that his “ten thousand days of imprisonment” had ended. Amidst a sea of supporters and media, Mandela raised his right fist and the crowd responded with a roar. “I had not been able to do that for twenty-seven years and it gave me a surge of strength and joy. . . . As I finally walked through those gates . . . I felt even at the age of seventy-one that my life was beginning anew.”1<p></p> <p></p> In the final years of his imprisonment, Mandela had entered into a hesitant dialogue with apartheid leaders, but he had rejected any con-ditional release that ignored the democratic rights of his people. Now, ongoing economic and political crises inside South Africa interacted with deep-seated global and regional changes to incline the apartheid regime to risk his release.<p></p> <p></p> The South African economy was under enormous strain following the application of international financial sanctions and given the ongoing political instability inside the country. The growing economic effects of globalization made conflict resolution imperative if the crisis-ridden economy was to stabilize. Internal dissent was on the rise.<p></p> <p></p> A major factor changing the geopolitics of the region was the inde-pendence in 1990 of the neighboring country of Namibia, which South Africa had occupied since World War I, and later even in defiance of United Nations resolutions. This had been hastened by South African military defeat in Angola at the hands of Cuba. Even more significant<p></p>  
<p></p> <p></p> 99<p></p>  
100	NELSON MANDELA<p></p> <p></p> was the end of the Cold War, which removed many obstacles to negotia-tions. The collapse of the socialist bloc in Eastern Europe meant that the ruling National Party could no longer use the specter of communism as an excuse not to negotiate, and for its part, the ANC now lacked a major material base to continue its armed struggle. As these events transpired, in retrospect Mandela’s decision to open negotiations seemed far-sighted.<p></p> <p></p> On February 2, President F. W. de Klerk had surprised many people by announcing at the opening of Parliament the unbanning of the ANC and other illegal political parties and the release of some political prisoners. He also foreshadowed a degree of political reform by scrapping some pillars of apartheid such as the Separate Amenities Act.<p></p> <p></p> All eyes were on Mandela to see if he could do what others had found impossible: end apartheid and bring peace to the troubled country. Every-where he received a hero’s welcome. Mandela immediately assumed lead-ership of the democratic movement. He also toured the world to thank many countries and their peoples for their solidarity. Over the next four years, Mandela would lead the thrust towards a transition to democracy, a complicated process at a time of great political conflict in which his dip-lomatic and tactical skills would be crucial. A new phase of South African history was opening.<p></p> <p></p> On the evening of February 11, 1990, Mandela returned to Cape Town to give a remarkable address from a balcony overlooking the vast Parade ground where hundreds of thousands of well-wishers thronged. He was both optimistic, declaring his faith in open negotiations to spark a genu-ine political transition to democracy, and cautious, urging vigilance. He conceded that F. W. de Klerk had gone further than any other apartheid leader, but warned of dangers ahead and pointed out that peace was impos-sible without free political activity and the release of all political prison-ers. Mandela appropriately and symbolically ended the speech with the same words he had spoken before going to prison 27 years earlier: he was prepared to struggle and if need be die to achieve a democratic and free society with equal opportunities for all.2<p></p> <p></p> Two days later, Mandela returned to his home in Soweto. He addressed a huge rally at Orlando Football Stadium. The massive welcome visibly touched him; it filled “my heart with joy.” Yet, he was saddened to learn of continued black suffering. He urged children to return to school, reiterating the message of his open letter to the press sent while still in prison on January 27, 1990, in which he called on youth “to arm them-selves with the most powerful weapons of modern times—education, and education.”3<p></p>

<p></p> Mandela threw himself into political work with the energy of a young man as the ANC quickly and effectively reestablished its structures inside the country. He also strode the world stage like a colossus. In March 1990, he traveled to Lusaka, Zambia to meet the ANC’s exiled leadership and then to Sweden to meet ANC President Oliver Tambo, recovering from a heart stroke. Mandela would replace Tambo as ANC leader the following year. In coming months, Mandela would travel the globe raising funds, but increased tension and the prospect of negotiations soon compelled him to return home.<p></p> <p></p> President De Klerk argues that initially he had known little of the secret government negotiations with Mandela, but gradually as he assumed power he become convinced, both by events and by his own religious calling, that he had to abandon the old racist dogmas of apartheid that he too had supported. His relationship with Mandela over the next four years would be complex, and at times sharp, but would be an important factor in determining the nature and rate of change.4<p></p> <p></p> As the ANC and the government came to the negotiating table, a new stage of the anti-apartheid struggle, one that was different and in some ways more difficult than before, now opened. Mandela was flexible on methods, but resolute on principle, and the enormous pressure for change from below helped him maintain this commitment. He was under pressure from all sides—white business wanted assurances against nationalization of their wealth; black labor wanted a fair redistribution of the national wealth always denied Africans.<p></p> <p></p> In this unfolding drama, Mandela would not be alone—a multitude of skilled people from within the ranks of the ANC and the broad dem-ocratic movement joined him in negotiations—but he would play the crucial role. If in the confines of the cold and windswept Robben Island, Mandela had unified the prisoners, then since 1985 five years of delicate, secret talks with government, prolonged debates with fellow prisoners over strategy and tactics, and his solitude all honed his negotiating skills. He would need such skills, for democracy in South Africa did not emerge spontaneously; rather, many people of goodwill built it laboriously in a protracted process that was accompanied by chronic violence as powerful, vested interests resisted change.<p></p> <p></p> Things at first moved fast. At the end of April 1990, the first official group of ANC leaders returned from exile. The forces of the ANC now merged with those of UDF to form an experienced negotiating team, led by Mandela. Three days of talks early in May produced the Groote Schuur Accord, in which the governing National Party and the ANC commit-ted to a process of negotiations and reduction of tension. In August, the<p></p>  
102	NELSON MANDELA<p></p> <p></p> Pretoria Minute, a written agreement between the government and the ANC, formalized further release of political prisoners by the state, while the ANC unilaterally agreed to suspend all armed actions.<p></p> <p></p> Unfortunately, serious political conflict would soon create roadblocks on the road to negotiations for a new constitution. Terrible political vio-lence wracked neighborhoods in some parts of the country. Many com-mentators accused the government, or at least a covert “third force,” of orchestrating internecine violence between the ANC and the conserva-tive Inkatha Freedom Party led by Mangosuthu Buthelezi, a paid official of the government’s Bantustan system. In June 1991, the “Inkathagate Scandal” revealed army involvement in secret political death squads, tar-nishing the reputation of De Klerk and Buthelezi, and prompting Mandela and the ANC to suspend bilateral meetings. The findings of the subse-quent Goldstone Commission into political violence largely confirmed Mandela’s misgivings about this mysterious “third force.”<p></p> <p></p> Nevertheless, Mandela and his leadership team pushed ahead, call-ing in July 1991 for the installation of an Interim Government. Mandela went into overdrive, urging peace: at one political rally in Natal, he risked raising the ire of his own supporters by urging them to abandon violence and throw their weapons into the sea. In September, he signed an impor-tant milestone, the National Peace Accord. However, discussions would remain protracted, with disagreements and periodic breakdown of talks.5<p></p> <p></p> Multiparty negotiations now took the form of the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (CODESA), a forum to negotiate a new con-stitution. Employing the notion of “sufficient consensus” to reach deci-sions, CODESA’s first meeting in December 1991 adopted a Declaration of Intent signed by all major political parties except the Inkatha Free-dom Party and the Bophuthatswana government. De Klerk, speaking last, apologized for apartheid policies but prevaricated on one person-one vote, insisting on special minority rights for whites through power sharing. De Klerk then questioned the ANC’s commitment to peace, urging the dis-banding of its armed wing, MK. Mandela was furious and demanded the right of reply, condemning De Klerk for trying to torpedo change and arguing that only with an Interim Government could the people, facing murderous political violence, renounce their self-defense units.<p></p> <p></p> The question of armed self-defense was an important one for Mandela at this time. The ANC was not willing to risk everything when many signs pointed to continuing danger. There were strong rumors of a coup by the army, many of whose leaders opposed De Klerk’s moves toward democracy. Buthelezi launched a violent campaign against the ANC, exploiting loopholes in customary law that allowed his followers to carry<p></p>

<p></p> “traditional weapons” that nevertheless could, and did, inflict serious harm. Although the very fact of Mandela’s release and the start of nego-tiations had spawned metaphors of a “small miracle” and the birth of a “new South Africa,” history suggested to many people a more pessimistic outcome. In this context, Mandela gave his blessing to his old Robben Island companion Mac Maharaj to strengthen MK underground structures inside the country through a campaign entitled Operation Vula. Maharaj eventually was arrested, but the ANC had shown that it could mount large-scale support backed by smuggled arms, and this acted as somewhat of a brake on those seeking to resort to a military coup.6<p></p> <p></p> Mandela played a pivotal role at this time, moderating ANC radicals but holding the government to the need for real change and an end to political violence. In February 1992, De Klerk accepted the ANC demand for an Interim Government, but a sticking point remained general consti-tutional principles. De Klerk faced strong opposition to change from far-right extremist Afrikaners wanting to retain their race-based privileges. Therefore, in March, but without consulting Mandela, he called a whites-only referendum, winning 67 percent support for his broad reforms.<p></p> <p></p> Negotiations continued around deciding a process toward democracy. There was general agreement around a Transitional Executive Council to prepare elections for an interim government and constituent assembly, but the second CODESA meeting in May 1992 deadlocked around the size of the majority needed to approve a new constitution. Then, a terri-ble massacre by pro-Inkatha armed hostel dwellers—with rumors of state involvement—of dozens of residents at Boipatong township in June 1992 saw Mandela accuse the regime of complicity and break off negotiations. De Klerk would still not agree to simple majority rule, but he eventually disbanded three security battalions suspected of covert terror and agreed to international monitoring of the conflict.<p></p> <p></p> The political pendulum now swung back and forth. The ANC and its allies, the powerful COSATU labor federation and the South African Communist Party (SACP, also legalized in 1990), now called the Tri-partite Alliance, launched a campaign of rolling protests. Such popular pressure helped bring the parties together again, and a September 1992 summit meeting agreed on a Record of Understanding around constitu-tional change, political prisoners, and conflict resolution. In the same month, however, serious violence again erupted, in Bisho, capital of the Ciskei Bantustan, where police opened fire on protesters, the massacre again delaying negotiations.<p></p> <p></p> Mandela and his negotiating team persisted despite all these interrup-tions and provocations. In particular, he showed his willingness to com-<p></p>  
104	NELSON MANDELA<p></p> <p></p> promise at times of crisis. In November 1992, negotiations resumed. Once again, violence intervened, this time nearly derailing the talks. The assas-sination of the charismatic and highly popular ANC and SACP leader Chris Hani in April 1993 by a right-wing terrorist created an explosive situation only defused by Mandela’s appeal for calm on national televi-sion. His timely intervention was facilitated by De Klerk, who, isolated in the rural areas at the time, sensed “this was Mandela’s moment, not mine.” Afterwards, Mandela needed all his tact when a mourn-ing crowd in Soweto, still enraged at the murder, booed his call for peace.7<p></p> <p></p> Talks resumed, now in the form of the Multi-Party Negotiating Forum to address the mechanics of a transition process. There was not, however, a complete consensus. Mandela’s old rivals, the Pan Africanist Congress and their allies the Azanian People’s Organization boycotted the talks, as did the Conservative Party, an Afrikaner break-away from De Klerk’s National Party. The final obstacles to peace would be from the Afrikaner far right wing and Inkatha, in a few last, desperate efforts to stave off the triumph of democracy.<p></p> <p></p> In June 1993, far right-wing extremist vigilantes used vehicles to ram the building where talks were underway but did not prevent agreement opening the way to elections. De Klerk now dropped demands for white minority rights. In November 1993, negotiators agreed an interim consti-tution legalizing elections to establish a Government of National Unity, and, in January 1994, a power-sharing Transitional Executive Council to oversee elections emerged.<p></p> <p></p> Mandela still had much work to do. Ultraconservative Afrikaners led by army General Constand Viljoen began to mobilize around the idea of<p></p> <p></p> self-governing Afrikaner volkstaat (homeland). In March 1994, they launched an abortive military action in the Bophuthatswana Bantustan. The complete failure of the adventure stimulated popular discontent that saw Bophuthatswana completely collapse, to be reincorporated into South Africa. Mandela intervened to guarantee Bophuthatswana civil servants their jobs in a future united South Africa. A crisis in another disintegrating Bantustan, Ciskei, saw it also reincorporated: the apart-heid dream of a racially divided constellation of quiescent black mini-states was over. Abandoning military intervention, Viljoen formed a legal party and, strongly encouraged by Mandela, agreed to contest the elections. Inkatha, which had withdrawn from talks, at the last minute agreed to take part in the election. Mandela had worked hard to allay the fears of all parties: for example, media images of him drinking tea with the aging widow of Verwoerd, the architect of apartheid, helped assure<p></p>  
FREE AT LAST	105
<p></p> Afrikaners that political change could accommodate their own culture and interests.<p></p> <p></p> Neither did Mandela ignore the important international dimensions of ending apartheid. From 1990, he toured widely, thanking countries for their support and gathering much-needed funds for the ANC’s future electoral needs. Once initial negotiations were agreed upon, in June 1990 he headed off on a six-week tour of Europe, the United Kingdom, North America, and Africa, everywhere greeted with acclaim and honors by heads of state. Hundreds of thousands of people lined the streets, as in New York City and Detroit, where he addressed huge crowds at Yankee and Tiger Stadiums respectively. The U.S. Congress gave him a stand-ing ovation. In Harlem, he attended the Canaan Baptist Church to pay tribute together with Jesse Jackson to all the American churches that had supported the anti-apartheid struggle.8<p></p> <p></p> Later in 1990, Mandela visited Norway, Zambia, India, and Australia, and in 1991 West Africa and South America. In December he met U.S. President George H. W. Bush. In the same month, Mandela addressed the United Nations General Assembly in New York, urging continued sanc-tions until free elections occurred.<p></p> <p></p> Eager to open up space for negotiations, the ANC initially encour-aged the partial lifting of sports sanctions but continued to lobby against premature lifting of economic sanctions, worried that change could easily still be derailed. However, in September 1993, while visiting the United States, Mandela articulated a change of strategy, now urging the lifting of economic sanctions. To encourage investment, he signaled that the ANC’s Freedom Charter policy of nationalization was only one possible policy option.<p></p> <p></p> The grueling schedule of overseas trips was important to raise funds for the cash-strapped ANC, banned for three decades. However, some-times there were dilemmas in accepting money. Mandela received gener-ous donations both from Indonesian military dictator Suharto, who had imposed massive human rights violations on the people of his own coun-try and those of East Timor, and from Nigeria’s Abacha dictatorship. On the other hand, those countries had been opponents of apartheid, as had many other states including Cuba and Libya, which Mandela continued to treat as friendly because of their solidarity. He found subtle ways to encourage conflict resolution: in September 1994, he urged Suharto to open dialogue with East Timorese resistance leaders and later met with resistance leader Xanana Gusmão.<p></p> <p></p> For the transition to democracy to succeed, there was a need for com-promise and social reconciliation. There were glimpses of hope. Despite<p></p>  
106	NELSON MANDELA<p></p> <p></p> clear tensions—Mandela had seriously questioned De Klerk’s integrity and held him partly responsible for savage attacks on ANC supporters— in 1993 the two men jointly received the Nobel Peace Prize “for their work for the peaceful termination of the apartheid regime, and for laying the foundations for a new democratic South Africa.” In his acceptance speech, Mandela praised De Klerk for having had “the courage to admit that a terrible wrong had been done to our country and people.” He paid tribute to previous Nobel Laureates, Albert Luthuli, Desmond Tutu, and Martin Luther King. He also spoke “as a representative of the millions of people across the globe, the anti-apartheid movement, the governments, and organizations” that had opposed apartheid. Mindful that interna-tional solidarity had contributed to his release, he reminded listeners that solidarity must continue, not just to ensure the final burying of apartheid but also to free another Nobel laureate, Aung San Suu Kyi of Burma.9<p></p> <p></p> Despite these triumphs, there was personal pain. Although the dedi-cated support of family and friends had made the lonely years of prison easier, new political obligations rent Mandela’s marriage asunder. In April 1992, he called a press conference to announce a separation, followed four years later by divorce. The breakup was painful on all sides. Some of Mandela’s peers saw Winnie as a political “loose canon,” and their pres-sure, notes fellow Robben Island veteran Fikile Bam, also moved Mandela to place national interests first. Family friend Fatima Meer blamed the media but observed that Mandela as chief negotiator felt obliged to sup-port “law and order” in the face of serious charges against Winnie over the 1989 events involving her Mandela Football Club gang. Mandela captured the dilemmas he constantly faced in balancing politics with family interests when recounting that his daughter Zindzi had felt that, after growing up without a father, she finally saw him return only to then become “father of the nation” instead.10<p></p> <p></p> Public attention now swung to elections. Could the ANC receive enough votes to govern in its own right? As Mandela sat in endless nego-tiating meetings, he realized the great disadvantage the ANC faced rela-tive to the well-established and well-funded National Party of De Klerk. More than seventeen million Africans had never voted, and most lived in rural areas, with illiteracy as high as 67 percent.11 Mandela continued to campaign tirelessly for the elections. He stood firm against Buthelezi, who wanted the elections delayed but who, at the very last minute, agreed to participate.<p></p> <p></p> Nelson Mandela’s role in this transition period was vital. He united and mobilized Africans and their allies as never before. On the world stage, he became a much-admired celebrity who accrued enormous respect,<p></p>  
FREE AT LAST	107
<p></p> goodwill, and support.12 Of course, Mandela would be the first to argue that many other individuals and organizations also were instrumental in this historical process. De Klerk broke the logjam of rigid Afrikaner poli-tics. A range of remarkable personalities, such as Archbishop Tutu and other church leaders like Beyers Naudé, and ANC and National Party leaders such as Cyril Ramaphosa and Rolf Meyer, Thabo Mbeki, and Joe Slovo were firmly behind the peace process. In addition, hundreds of thousands of ordinary South Africans had had enough of violence and racism, and through their attendance at countless rallies they “voted with their feet” in favor of democracy. Yet, it was Mandela who had initiated and then driven this process to its conclusion, providing inspired leader-ship at every turn.<p></p> <p></p> It had indeed been a “long walk to freedom,” and Mandela anxiously but optimistically awaited the outcome of the election.<p></p> <p></p> <p></p> NOTES<p></p> <p></p> 1.

<p></p> <p></p> Chapter 9<p></p> <p></p> PRESIDENCY AND NEW<p></p> <p></p> CHALLENGES<p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> On April 27, 1994, South Africans stood in snaking queues around the country as millions of Africans, many of them elderly, voted for the first time in their lives. There had been last-minute hitches: only at the very last minute had the conservative Inkatha Freedom Party agreed to take part in the election, and ballot papers had to have its emblem glued on top. Prospects for peace in the conflict-wracked province of Natal domi-nated by Inkatha’s rural power base still seemed dim, and Nelson Mandela decided to go there himself to cast his own vote as a way of showing the people it was safe to vote.<p></p> <p></p> It was a poignant moment, full of historic symbolism. Mandela chose to vote at Ohlange School, not far from the grave of John Dube. Educated in the African American Tuskegee College, Dube in 1912 had become founder-president of the ANC. Dube’s mission of unity and nonracialism, mused Mandela, was about to be fulfilled. Across the verdant valley lay the settlement of Phoenix, where Mahatma Gandhi’s printing press had proclaimed similarly the need for racial and political tolerance. At the age of 76, Mandela voted in a national election for the first time ever. The denial to Africans of such a basic human right as the vote had under-pinned the very fabric of colonialism and then apartheid, but Mandela was determined to make a fresh start.<p></p> <p></p> The result was a landslide victory to Mandela and the ANC, with 62.6 percent of the vote. This was just short of the two-thirds required for the ANC to change the constitution on its own, but Mandela was pleased in the sense that the need for cooperation with other political parties would strengthen multiparty democracy. Despite a bad case of influenza,<p></p>  
<p></p> <p></p> 109<p></p>  
110	NELSON MANDELA<p></p> <p></p> he joined the celebrations. Among foreign dignitaries present was Coretta Scott King, widow of Martin Luther King Jr. In his address Mandela, look-ing directly at her, invoked the memory of her late husband. His com-ments captured the significance of the historic day:<p></p> <p></p> This is one of the most important moments in the life of our country. I stand here before you filled with deep pride and joy—pride in the ordinary, humble people of this country. You have shown such a calm, patient determination to reclaim this country as your own, and now the joy that we can loudly pro-claim from the rooftops—Free at last! Free at last! . . . This is a time to heal the old wounds and build a new South Africa.1<p></p> <p></p> The country went crazy with joy. There were wild celebrations in the black townships; even the once repressive police joined in, honking their car horns. South Africa was indeed “Free At Last,” reported the New York Times.2<p></p> <p></p> On May 9, the first session of the new National Assembly elected Mandela unopposed as president of South Africa. The next day was his presidential inauguration at the Union Buildings in the capital, Pretoria. Among the 4,000 guests were anti-apartheid activists from around the world and even some of Mandela’s prison warders. An unusually varied cross-section of foreign visitors was present, ranging from U.S. govern-ment representatives Vice President Al Gore and First Lady Hillary Clin-ton, to Fidel Castro, Israeli President Chaim Hertzog, and the Palestine Liberation Organization’s Yasser Arafat, and numerous African leaders such as Julius Nyerere, together with Prince Charles of England. It was testimony to the breadth not only of ANC diplomatic ties but also of Mandela’s aura. His inauguration speech was short but inspirational. He concluded by stating, “Let there be justice for all. Let there be peace for all. Let there be work, bread, water and salt for all. . . . Never, never and never again shall it be that this beautiful land will again experience the oppression of one by another and suffer the indignity of being the skunk of the world. Let freedom reign.”3<p></p> <p></p> Later in the year Mandela’s autobiography, Long Walk to Freedom, which many years earlier had been smuggled out of prison by Mac Maha-raj, broke all South African book sale records. Mandela concluded the book by emphasizing the huge task ahead to bring reconciliation to a nation deeply divided by race hatred. All people, he reasoned, includ-ing the oppressor, needed liberating, and South Africans had only taken the first step to freedom on a long, difficult road to respect the rights<p></p>  
PRESIDENCY AND NEW CHALLENGES	111
<p></p> of all: “I have walked that long road to freedom. . . . But I can rest only for a moment, for with freedom comes responsibilities, and I dare not linger, for my long walk is not yet ended.”4<p></p> Over the next five years, Mandela and his government would go a very long way toward laying the groundwork for such reconciliation. In large part this would be due to his own selfless work and dedication, and his personal tolerance and foresight, even though, as he predicted, many further problems awaited him.<p></p> <p></p> The Mandela administration (1994–1999) achieved impressive advances in establishing democracy and encouraging reconciliation, and in provid-ing cheap housing, electricity, and clean water for millions of people in the black townships. It also secured economic stability inside the country and became a force, even a successful model, for peace around the world.<p></p> <p></p> Mandela’s primary role at this time was to achieve unity, both within the ANC and across the country as a whole. At the ANC’s first national conference since assuming the reigns of political power, he carefully bal-anced competing demands for restitution of black rights with pragmatic requirements for economic growth in a globalizing world economy. If, by his own measure, the ANC would be judged on whether its decisions “bring practical relief to the millions” who supported it, then given the fact that business demands often appeared to outweigh “practical relief,” Mandela could still point to national unity, peace, and stability as his government’s crowning achievements.5<p></p> <p></p> While apartheid was now dead, elements of its socioeconomic legacy persisted to limit the impact of Mandela’s policies. Post-apartheid South Africa faced mammoth tasks: to consolidate democracy, lessen the social inequality inherited from 300 years of colonialism, and improve the day-to-day lives of the people. In general, enormous strides took place to achieve a measure of success in all these fields, for which Mandela can justly claim credit.<p></p> <p></p> Democracy was Mandela’s first major achievement. At first, he headed a government of national unity with both De Klerk and Thabo Mbeki serving as vice presidents. In 1996, De Klerk took the National Party out of government and the ANC governed in its own right. Two further successful national elections, in 1999 and 2004, confirmed the resilience of the multiparty democracy Mandela had championed, although some political analysts warned of the dangers of a “dominant party system” given the ANC’s great electoral strength rooted in its historical leadership and in the country’s demography. Nevertheless, South Africa developed a pluralistic state with well-established opposition parties, a vibrant civil society, and an independent press, all of which Mandela encouraged.<p></p>  
112	NELSON MANDELA<p></p> <p></p> The newly elected Parliament sat first as a Constitutional Assembly, which created a Constitutional Court, comprising 11 independent judges. This court was empowered to certify a new constitution and ensure it com-plied with the Constitutional Principles agreed by negotiators. Mandela and his legal advisors encouraged a very wide process of public consulta-tion to decide the sorts of principles a new constitution should embody.<p></p> <p></p> The result was impressive. Many commentators view the new constitu-tion eventually adopted in 1996 as the most forward-looking in the world. Unlike the apartheid-era “tricameral” Constitution of 1983 that institu-tionalized racial categories, the 1996 Constitution contains firm guaran-tees of equality. Underlying its principles (as in the U.S. Constitution) are equality, democracy, responsibility, and freedom, but also included are ideas of reconciliation and diversity. This Constitution, likely to be one of Mandela’s greatest legacies, includes a Bill of Rights affirming human dignity, equality, and freedom. In addition, reflecting the recent times in which it appeared, the Constitution guarantees the right to basic and higher education, and adequate housing, the right to work and strike, the right of access to information, gender and sexual-persuasion rights, and protection of children and the environment. It asserts that “the state may not unfairly discriminate directly or indirectly against anyone on one or more grounds, including race, gender, sex, pregnancy, marital status, ethnic or social origin, colour, sexual orientation, age, disability, religion, conscience, belief, culture, language, and birth.”6<p></p> <p></p> Recent history had seen the growing role of women in politics. In 1984 the ANC had accepted “non-sexism” as part of its vision for a new South Africa. Mandela embraced this policy. In an interview in 2005, he recounted that while on Robben Island he had read widely of the growing role of women in politics around the world, and that this had reminded him of the role of the mother of the first Mandela, the founder of his clan, who had fought the British colonial invaders. As president, he soon adopted gender-neutral terms in his speeches. There is little doubt that African women massively supported Mandela and the ANC in national elections in 1994 and 1999, and that the 1996 Constitution is the most gender-sensitive in the world.7<p></p> <p></p> The Mandela administration’s achievements in the economy varied. The extension of housing, electricity, and clean water to a million poorer people, the right to land, free health care to pregnant women, and secu-rity for labor tenants were all substantial. As presidential initiatives, Mandela introduced a program of free milk for elementary school students and health care for mothers and children. All people were now free to live wherever they wished—if they could afford it. The government sought to<p></p>  
PRESIDENCY AND NEW CHALLENGES	113
<p></p> create a more “level playing field” for black business and labor: it encour-aged black economic empowerment, legalized strikes, and encouraged tripartite industrial conciliation between business, labor, and the state.<p></p> <p></p> However, the pace of economic change was slow, with little apprecia-ble redistribution of national wealth. In part, this was due to entrenched white power within the economy and the state apparatus. Mandela’s cabi-net made definite progress in the construction of a new, nonracial bureau-cracy based on merit rather than race, but the commanding heights of the economy still remained largely in white hands and Mandela was loathe to precipitate capital flight by nationalization or by antagonizing the banks. In this regard, he succeeded in stemming capital flight.<p></p> <p></p> Within the ANC and its electoral allies the Congress of South African Trade Unions and the South African Communist Party, which together formed the Tripartite Alliance, support was overwhelmingly for a redistri-bution of wealth in favor of the historically disadvantaged black majority. In accord with these popular demands, the Mandela government’s initial economic policy framework, the Reconstruction and Development Pro-gram (RDP), built upon the traditional policies of the ANC (as outlined in the Freedom Charter) and its labor and political allies. The RDP envis-aged such redistribution and social equality, but simultaneously sought to boost domestic capital accumulation.<p></p> <p></p> However, under strong pressure from both corporate interests and ANC economic conservatives such as Thabo Mbeki, in 1996 Mandela agreed to replace the RDP with the pro-business (or “neoliberal”) Growth, Employ-ment, and Redistribution (GEAR) strategy. By 1999, Mandela’s admin-istration could boast of its strict financial management, low inflation, and the impressive elimination of the public debt of Rand 250 billion (in today’s terms, about $35 billion; the rand is the South African currency). On the other hand, despite promises from the wealthy “North” (devel-oped countries) of massive investment, this was modest. The personal goodwill extended to Mandela probably accounted for some inflow, but the failure of donors to invest on a large scale encouraged the new gov-ernment to embrace other policies. Mandela also had to confront chang-ing international approaches to aid: despite close relations, direct U.S. government aid to South Africa actually declined fourfold as Washington prioritized private investment instead.<p></p> <p></p> Mandela’s gamble on GEAR backfired in that a projected growth of 1.3 million jobs between 1996 and 2001 actually resulted in the loss of more than one million jobs. GEAR’s projected growth and investment rates were not met. In contradiction to his 1994 election pledges, Mandela also decided to embrace privatization of state services. There was a sad irony<p></p>  
114	NELSON MANDELA<p></p> <p></p> here, when some poor Africans who had finally received clean water and electricity for the first time in their lives soon lost this access due to their inability to pay for newly privatized services. As privatization and globalization advanced, unemployment soared, with massive job losses in South Africa’s key mining sector and other industries. Mandela and his ministers came up with various short-term job creation and poverty-reduction initiatives, but these had limited impact given entrenched white economic power and global markets, and Mandela’s own reluctance to scare away business by seriously tackling the structural roots of black pov-erty. Instead he opted for a conservative “trickle-down” approach. Some critics claimed that economic power still resided among white corporate interests and that despite the growth of a new black elite stratum, ANC rule represented merely black empowerment for a tiny group; an “elite transition.”8<p></p> <p></p> Given the short time period of five years involved, vis-à-vis the gargan-tuan historical inequalities of South Africa, these criticisms can appear harsh. Running a country was not the same as leading a political party, and it involved compromises. Furthermore, although the ANC had won the election, many believed they were not quite able to secure real power.<p></p> <p></p> Nevertheless, when considered from the point of view of the living conditions of the overwhelming majority of the population and their rising expectations, some of Mandela’s macroeconomic decisions appear unwise in retrospect. South Africa’s market economy, previously safe-guarded by protectionism, was changing rapidly and was unable to absorb new workers or meet rising expectations. Undeniably, big business exerted considerable influence on Mandela. Their seductive overtures had begun in the transition period and steadily increased, and he had to decide one way or the other on the direction of future economic policy. Increasingly, as his authorized biographer observes, Mandela enjoyed the company of rich white businesspeople in Johannesburg’s luxurious northern neigh-borhoods. Moreover, powerful globalization trends, the need for foreign investment, and low mineral prices, all encouraged Mandela to opt for fiscal prudence and neoliberal monetarist policies, and to compromise on the ANC’s reform agenda. In this, he was strongly encouraged by Mbeki and the banks. Finally, the imposition of GEAR from above, rather than below, reflected the danger of a creeping antidemocratic trend that, if not the fault of any one person such as Mandela, remains a concern in present-day South Africa.9<p></p> <p></p> Nelson Mandela the president had to face other serious problems. Land reform epitomizes post-apartheid compromise. Land dispossession lay at the heart of the inequality of colonial and apartheid South Africa: millions<p></p>  
PRESIDENCY AND NEW CHALLENGES	115
<p></p> of blacks had lost their lands. Land reform therefore became a central ANC policy. Mandela made sure that the first legislation enacted after the water-shed 1994 elections was the Restitution of Land Rights Act. Since then, there has been considerable, if slow and cumbersome, progress towards land restitution. In both rural and urban landscapes, the unequal infrastructure that is the physical legacy of apartheid undoubtedly will remain for some time, but Mandela at least made a start to an orderly process of compensa-tion and legally binding land rights.<p></p> <p></p> More menacing and apparently irresolvable has been the HIV-AIDS pandemic, which hit South Africa with all the shocking force of a collid-ing freight train. The causes of its rapid spread were rooted in factors such as virus transmission through transport routes, prostitution, and reluctance by traditionalists to embrace safe sex practices, while poverty exacerbated its impact. Mandela and his cabinet, naturally enough preoccupied with nation building and reconciliation, were too slow to perceive the growing magnitude of the problem to act decisively to reduce its spread.<p></p> <p></p> The number of infected pregnant women rose from 0.7 percent in 1990, to 10.5 percent in 1995, and 22 percent in 1999, by which time an estimated four million people, or one-ninth of the entire population, were infected. Government funding scandals and differences between central and provincial administrations only made things worse. Mandela seemed unprepared, perhaps due to his generation and culture, to lead such a cam-paign personally, as had been the case with the presidents of the African countries of Uganda and Botswana. One medical researcher who raised the issue with Mandela early in his presidency found him courteous, but clearly preoccupied with the big political issues of the day. Probably the “greatest weakness” then of Mandela’s leadership was this failure to lead the fight against the pandemic; over the following decade, as will be seen in the next chapter, he would seek to make amends.10<p></p> <p></p> Despite these major problems, Mandela scored other impressive social victories. His boldest initiative to heal the deep divisions of the past was the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), probably the most widespread investigation into past injustices the world has ever known. Established by Mandela in 1995 under the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act and led at his insistence by fellow Nobel Peace Prize winner Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the TRC mandate from Mandela was to investigate gross human rights violations perpetrated between 1960 and 1993 to prevent them happening again and to unify a nation deeply divided by apartheid. Given a political motive for a crime and full, public testimony, then the TRC could offer amnesty to perpetrators. The expo-sure of atrocities in the dramatic proceedings of the commission, televised<p></p>  
116	NELSON MANDELA<p></p> <p></p> live, brought much pain to those involved but also had the cathartic power to help steer South Africa away from an endless cycle of violence in a boldly democratic direction.11<p></p> The TRC’s emphasis on “restorative” rather than “retributive” justice related closely to the political compromises of the transition period that Mandela had pursued. The TRC did receive criticism, for example from the family of Steve Biko, for failing to bring to justice some of the worst perpetrators of crimes, and the reparations process was not particularly generous to victims’ families. Despite such shortcomings, the proceedings had a therapeutic effect, enabling the country to transcend the violence of apartheid. A good measure of social reconciliation ensued and con-tributed to social peace and stability; the lessons to the world for conflict resolution were profound. Again, Mandela had achieved the seemingly impossible.12<p></p> <p></p> In the field of reconciliation, Nelson Mandela led by personal example: his dramatic appearance in a Springbok jersey (that of team Captain Fran-çois Pienaar) on the hallowed turf of Afrikaner rugby, Ellis Park, to join celebrations for South Africa’s 1995 World Cup victory, and his drinking tea with the aging widow of the architect of apartheid, Verwoerd, epito-mized reconciliation. Such gestures were a potent symbol to whites to leave behind the racial tensions of the past and work together with blacks to build a New South Africa.<p></p> <p></p> In many other areas, Mandela and his administration left a lasting impact. Education and sports were steadily desegregated, culture freed from the shackles of apartheid censorship, and religious communities that had suffered under apartheid flourished. Rural development, road build-ing, and environmental conservation measures expanded, and funds to combat poverty increased.<p></p> <p></p> The heritage of South Africa also underwent transformation. In the past, museums had depicted the triumphal march of white settlers; there was little space for the stories of Africans. Symbolically, Mandela returned to Robben Island in September 1997 to launch on its soil a new kind of heritage museum devoted to all South Africans. “Let us,” he stated, “recommit ourselves to the ideals in our Constitution, ideals which were shaped in the struggles here on Robben Island and in the greater prison that was apartheid South Africa.”13<p></p> Mandela’s long years of dutiful physical exercise and hard work stood him in good stead for the rigors of the presidency. In July 1994, he under-went eye surgery for a cataract, complicated by his experience of forced labor in the lime pits of Robben Island, but overall he displayed remark-able health for an octogenarian.<p></p>  
PRESIDENCY AND NEW CHALLENGES	117
<p></p> Mandela’s personal and reflective style of government, characterized by some as consensual and by others as the “gracious patrician” in a “patri-archal meditative mode,”14 could disarm his critics. If, as Constitutional Court judge Albie Sachs noted, Mandela was viewed by some as a “natural patriarch” and by others as a “a natural democrat,” he was quick to adapt to the complicated public and private lives of a president. He disliked bureaucratic routine, and at times made unilateral decisions, but people seemed to forgive his cheerful impetuosity not least because he humanized government.15<p></p> <p></p> Mandela’s reputation as a great survivor and a person who eschewed bitterness for reconciliation, together with his dignity and warm per-sonal style, captured the admiration of millions at home and abroad. Particularly endearing was his impish sense of humor and broad smile. Everything about him, from his slow meandering speeches, his wearing of colorful African shirts, and his ability even at the age of 80 to do a little impromptu African dance, evoked the image of the kindly grandfa-ther, the father of the nation. In the glare of publicity accorded a presi-dent, Mandela “remained a star performer who could play all the parts: the African chief, the Western President, the sportsman, the philosopher, the jiver with the ‘Madiba shuffle,’” and his dress shifted effortlessly from “dark suit to a loose flowery shirt to a rugby jersey to a T-shirt and baseball cap.” At home and abroad, “Madiba magic” seemed to offer solutions to intractable problems.16<p></p> <p></p> In external relations and foreign trade, Mandela scored further victo-ries. Trade more than doubled during his presidency. Under Mandela’s astute leadership, South Africa emerged from pariah status to become a respected “middle power” (such as, for example, Canada or Australia) capable of launching its own initiatives to combat world inequalities or to champion world peace.<p></p> <p></p> Spearheading this new foreign policy was Mandela himself, “a giant” who strode the “world scene.” He led several sorties aimed at bringing peace to troubled lands, including Northern Ireland, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Angola, and Burundi. South Africa made major contributions to United Nations peace missions in Africa, actively sup-ported nuclear disarmament, and secured election to major interna-tional bodies. South Africa under Mandela strongly endorsed human rights and ethics in international relations. It led the international cam-paign against the misery caused to civilians by land mines. In a speech at Oxford University in 1997, Mandela made an impassioned plea for peace: “Can we say with confidence that it is within our reach to declare that never again shall continents, countries or communities be reduced<p></p>  
118	NELSON MANDELA<p></p> <p></p> to the smoking battlefields of contending forces of nationality, religion, race, or language?” 17<p></p> Mandela clearly recognized the importance of U.S. relations for South Africa. He established a very successful Bi-National Commission headed by Vice Presidents Gore and Mbeki, and in 1998 President Clinton made a successful visit to South Africa, the first ever by a serving U.S. presi-dent. In his address to the Joint Session of the U.S. Houses of Congress in September 1994, Mandela paid tribute to the “understanding among the millions of our people that here we have friends, here we have fight-ers against racism who feel hurt because we are hurt, who seek our suc-cess because they too seek the victory of democracy over tyranny.” Yet friendship with one country did not mean to Mandela abandonment of “old friends” who had materially supported the ANC’s struggle, such as Cuba and Libya. Here Mandela made use of his extensive contacts and his enormous personal moral capital to act successfully as a go-between to resolve the difficult problem of Libya and the Lockerbie bombing, a suc-cess that underscored his great skill as a mediator. On all foreign issues, he insisted that South Africa be independent, and nonaligned, and where he thought necessary he criticized U.S. policy, as over American pharma-ceutical companies’ refusal to supply cheap, generic AIDS drugs to South Africans. In general, however, U.S.-South African relations under Man-dela reflected shared values and mutual interests.18<p></p> <p></p> Mandela helped South Africa integrate into Africa. African countries had naturally kept their distance from the apartheid regime, but under Mandela, there was a rush on both sides to embrace new, friendly rela-tions. Mandela strongly asserted South Africa’s new identity as part of Africa, and also as part of the less developed “South.” However, all was not smooth sailing for Mandela as African countries harbored suspicions that South Africa, with its greater economic power, might dominate. Although South African companies did rapidly expand their operations into Africa, Mandela encouraged his country to offer selfless assistance to neighbors, such as Mozambique and Angola, and to engage in mutually beneficial relations across the continent.<p></p> <p></p> In some other foreign policy arenas, Mandela faced dilemmas. Taiwan had invested heavily in apartheid South Africa; it also wooed the ANC with large donations. However, China made clear it would not toler-ate a “two Chinas” policy. After initially signaling that Pretoria would continue to trade with Taiwan, Mandela, who came to see Beijing’s tre-mendous growth potential, changed course to recognize Beijing in 1998. Another controversial event was South Africa’s military intervention in neighboring Lesotho, where clumsy efforts to reestablish democracy saw unnecessary loss of life.<p></p>  
PRESIDENCY AND NEW CHALLENGES	119
<p></p> Even more controversially, Mandela the advocate and harbinger of peace at home, who had cut defense spending by half, found himself sup-porting South Africa’s large and profitable arms industry, built up under apartheid. Under his presidency, the industry continued to exports arms and profit from wars and destruction, posing the question of government priorities. Other controversies erupted over Mandela’s hypocritical will-ingness to accept large donations to the ANC from dictators in Nigeria and Indonesia (see chapter 8). He pursued a delicate foreign policy with some African states. When in 1995 Nigerian dictator Abacha executed the writer and human rights activist Ken Saro-Wiwa, Mandela’s policy of “quiet diplomacy” toward Nigeria within the Commonwealth backfired. When an outraged Mandela changed his tune, calling for stiff counter-measures, the lukewarm response by both Western and African countries, and by his vice president, Mbeki, disappointed him.<p></p> <p></p> Beyond the glow of Mandela’s rosy international reception, his personal life faced disruption. The final divorce with Winnie Madikizela-Mandela came in 1996 with considerable publicity and rancor. It was clear that both parties had lost their former love for each other. Each accused the other of neglect. In 1994, Mandela had briefly appointed Winnie a deputy minister, only to dismiss her after outspoken criticism of his government and controversial business operations. In the years since their separation, he had made extensive payments, rumored to amount to several million Rand, to cover her legal costs, but she refused an amicable settlement. In the divorce proceedings, she sought to exploit customary law, but Mandela retorted, “I respect custom, but I am not a tribalist.” Finally, Winnie was legally obliged to vacate the family home.19<p></p> <p></p> On July 18, 1998, his eightieth birthday, Mandela married Graça Machel. Born in 1945, she was the widow of the assassinated president of Mozambique, and had been active in charity work for refugees. Man-dela had courted her persistently for years and found in her a political and cultural soul mate; he was, she said, “so easy to love.” At the wed-ding reception, Mandela danced his “famous Madiba shuffle around the confetti-strewn dance floor.” Remarriage eased the loneliness he had endured since the rupture with Winnie and the passing of many family members, such as his sister Leabie, who died in 1997.20<p></p> <p></p> Mandela did not intend to monopolize power. In 1997, at the ANC’s 50th annual congress, he handed over the ANC presidency to Thabo Mbeki, who two years later steered the movement to victory in South Africa’s second democratic election. Over several years, Mandela had blooded Mbeki into the future role of president by stepping back from day-to-day tasks and letting the younger man assume important respon-sibilities.<p></p>  
120	NELSON MANDELA<p></p> <p></p> Mandela left a rich legacy of splendid achievements and magnanimity. That he had inherited a complex country steeped in social and racial divi-sions with very different interest groups constantly jockeying for power partly explains some of the contradictory decisions he made in office. Yet as he stepped down from power, even at the age of 81, he did not intend to retire.<p></p> <p></p> NOTES<p></p> <p></p> Nelson Mandela, Long Walk to Freedom: The Autobiography of Nelson Mandela (Boston: Little, Brown, 1994), pp. 539–540.<p></p> <p></p> “Celebrations Rock the Townships,” South (Cape Town), May 6, 1994; Bill Keller, “Mandela Proclaims a Victory: South Africa Is ‘Free At Last!’ ” New York Times, May 3, 1994.<p></p> <p></p> Mandela, “Address to the Nation 10 May 1994,” in Nelson Mandela in His Own Words, ed.

<p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> Chapter 10<p></p> <p></p> AFTER THE PRESIDENCY<p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> It was a hard act to follow—from prisoner-for-life to president—but despite now being in his eighties Nelson Mandela continued to work for his country and for humanitarian causes after 1999, when Thabo Mbeki took over as president of South Africa.<p></p> <p></p> The ANC under Thabo Mbeki continued Mandela’s broad program to overcome the bitter legacy of apartheid and build a new South Africa. There was continued strong economic growth, including among the small but rising black elite, and the championing of peace and human rights abroad. However, these achievements could not mask enduring problems at home. The HIV-AIDS problem intensified. Mbeki went so far as deny-ing the clinical evidence of the disease. His government did challenge transnational corporations to provide retroviral drugs more cheaply to South Africa, but vital years were lost while his government dithered over preferred treatments; his Minister of Health aroused international con-demnation and derision when she favored the use of fruit juice and garlic over medically approved drugs.<p></p> <p></p> Very high black unemployment and acute inequality remained another plague. Mbeki sought ways to mitigate poverty and unemployment, but many poor people continued to live in unhealthy and inadequate hous-ing with irregular water and power services, the privatization of which made such necessities of life even more inaccessible. By now, government leaders had abandoned many of the ANC’s earlier progressive social pro-grams, echoing processes in other postcolonial African countries. Mbeki substituted in their place black pride through the “African Renaissance,” a concept first mooted by Mandela.1<p></p>  
<p></p> <p></p> 123<p></p>  
124	NELSON MANDELA<p></p> <p></p> Notwithstanding these problems, the movement to which Mandela had devoted his life had achieved several outstanding victories, not least the ending of apartheid, the establishment of democracy, and the winning of three consecutive elections. Mandela could now look back on the pre-vious five years as having realized his major life achievements.<p></p> <p></p> Mandela was in some ways even more outspoken after leaving office. His continuing commitment to helping the weak animates the work of the Nelson Mandela Foundation, which assists children and HIV-AIDS sufferers. The “46664: Give One Minute of Your Life to AIDS” campaign referred to Mandela’s prison number on Robben Island: he was prisoner number 466 of 1964. In 2002, he publicly embraced militant South African AIDS activist Zackie Achmat, and in July 2004 he addressed an Inter-national AIDS Conference in Thailand.<p></p> <p></p> Madiba’s newfound energy to combat the HIV-AIDS pandemic re-flected his continuing commitment to his country and his people. He proudly wore an “I Am an HIV Treatment Supporter” T-shirt in public to show his solidarity with, and to help destigmatize, sufferers. In 2005, he tearfully but truthfully announced publicly that his own son, Makgatho, had died of the disease.<p></p> <p></p> He maintained a busy work schedule and through the Nelson Mandela Foundation and the Nelson Mandela Children’s Fund channeled resources to the disadvantaged. In 1994, Mandela had vowed to donate R150,000 of his presidential salary to children’s welfare, and together with his new wife, Graça Machel, he intensified these efforts after leaving office, mak-ing good use of international events such as concerts to raise funds.<p></p> <p></p> In his typically audacious and African patriarch’s style, after publicly condemning the aggressive policies of the George W. Bush administra-tion in Iraq as a “tragedy,” Mandela called his father, George H. W. Bush, to admonish his son when the latter failed to reply to his telephone call. Conversely, if Mandela had become an international celebrity, then he was neither infallible nor above criticism. Mandela welcomed the dog-gedly persistent investigative journalist John Pilger, banned from South Africa by the apartheid regime in the 1960s, back there with a smile, and with a wisecrack that “to have been banned from my country is a great honor.” When Pilger asked him point-blank about the financial support of Indonesian dictator Suharto for the ANC, Mandela asked Pilger if he thought he had perhaps been too soft on Suharto, conceding that such things were to him often “a dilemma.” Pilger in turn could not but con-cede Mandela’s grace.2<p></p> <p></p> An event in July 2007 epitomizes Mandela’s continued commitment to world peace and equality. He agreed to use his 89th birthday to mark<p></p>  
AFTER THE PRESIDENCY	125
<p></p> the launch of a new elite group of retired public figures. In Johannes-burg, under the spreading canopy of a futuristic dome, “The Elders” of the global village, including former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, and former U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, vowed to address world problems. Mandela, although now frail and not expected to do a great deal on the committee, hoped that by “using their collective experience, their moral courage, and their ability to rise above nation, race, and creed,” the little group could “make our planet a more peaceful and equitable place to live.” Simultaneously, in Cape Town a star-studded “90 Minutes for Mandela” soccer match raised funds for humanitarian purposes. In September 2007, The Elders sent a peace delegation to con-flict-ridden Darfur. The idea of The Elders had originated from British billionaire Richard Branson and rock star Peter Gabriel, but the notion of “the wisdom of the elders” clearly resonated with Mandela’s own African culture.3<p></p> <p></p> No one can either doubt the sincerity of such projects or not marvel at the continued commitment of Mandela to a better world. Yet, realisti-cally, whether current or future world leaders would even deign to listen to such a group or still less, act on its recommendations is problematic. Here the dynamic tension in Mandela’s life work between his great strug-gles for righteous causes and the external forces that often impeded him is apparent. More cynical observers might even question the elitist nature of The Elders and ask whether Mandela, and those who make use of his good name, have purposively cultivated the image of Mandela the elder states-person while neglecting other, more broad-based forms of consultation equally embedded in both African and Western democratic traditions. In any case, Mandela’s great struggle for a righteous cause continues and will continue into the future as part of his legacy.<p></p> <p></p> In 2006, at the venerable age of 88, Mandela finally conceded that he had officially retired and declined further interviews. There were rumors that the South African government had asked him to stop commenting publicly on controversial issues, especially the AIDS epidemic. Mandela the elder, despite periodic requests for his presence, now had more time to devote to his family. In Graça, he had found much more than a new companion; she shared his vision for a better world. The adjustment from lifetime political prisoner had brought problems of adjustment to new life-styles. Mandela and his fellow ex-prisoners “found it difficult to adjust to our new family situations.” The families had to get on with their liv-ing and “We were unable to dance with them.” Yet behind this familial gulf, there was the logic of history. “Our vision of a future for our people blinded us to any other view. And perhaps that’s the way it has to be.” But<p></p>  
126	NELSON MANDELA<p></p> <p></p> now, with Graça at his side, Mandela could savor the delights of family life and enjoy the company of his many grandchildren.4<p></p> There was time now to spend between the city and the country. In his home village of Qunu, a new, modest Mandela Museum arose. The wheel of life had turned full circle. Mandela had returned, after years of adven-ture and toil, first in the 1940s in the City of Gold among black miners and radical activists, then from the 1950s living the dangerous life of the underground and prison, finally to lead the “miracle” of South Africa’s democratic transformation. Now he could bask in the patrician aura once enjoyed by his noble forebears.<p></p> <p></p> Over the years, as noted in Chapter 7, the world had bestowed upon Nelson Mandela numerous awards and high honors, with streets, schools, and parks named in his honor. They would take many pages just to list, but besides the 1993 Nobel Peace Prize, the International Gandhi Peace Prize, and numerous honorary doctorates, in 2002 he received the Presi-dential Medal of Freedom, the United States’ highest civilian award.5<p></p> <p></p> Nelson Mandela’s legacy to South Africa, Africa, and the world is immense. He was, as his successor Thabo Mbeki notes, “A child of the ANC.”6 Mandela would be the first to agree that overcoming 300 years of a very different—a colonial—legacy was always a joint effort spearheaded by the movement to which he devoted his life. Yet, if it was Mandela the team player who united and lead the ANC then it was Mandela the individual who initiated negotiations and who secured the moral high ground in the crucial transition period. He did so by personal example, by the exemplary nature of his character, his suffering, and his magnanimous forgiving of old enemies. Mandela’s deft combination of his personal gifts with the organizational appeal of the ANC is the key to understanding his success as a politician.<p></p> <p></p> Always, Mandela’s motivation was freedom and a better life for his peo-ple; if in the 1930s this meant the Thembu or Xhosa, by the 1950s it had widened to include all Africans and later to embrace South Africans of all races and political persuasions, including his former political enemies.<p></p> <p></p> His greatest legacy to South Africa is freedom and a working, stable democracy, a humane and entirely modern constitution, and a solid start on the long road to reconciliation and equitable socioeconomic develop-ment. His legacy to Africa and the world is renewed hope in the power amicably to resolve deep-seated conflicts and to leave behind forever the hatred of racism and war.<p></p> <p></p> The accomplishments of Mandela’s relatively brief administration from 1994 to 1999 are considerable. Firstly, he helped bring peace to a country ravaged by decades of civil conflict and on the verge of civil<p></p>  
AFTER THE PRESIDENCY	127
<p></p> war. Second, he ushered in democracy and freedom for blacks after 300 years of authoritarian colonialism, land dispossession, and racism. Third, Mandela’s government made substantial progress in the direction of redressing such inherited problems and moving on toward a plural and more tolerant society, in the manner of the Truth and Reconcili-ation Commission and land reform. Fourth, the living conditions for the majority of the people improved with the provision of hundreds of thousands of new houses, electricity provision to millions of Africans, and the establishment of nonracial socioeconomic structures and peace. Perhaps most of all, a new South Africa emerged, which if it still carried the burden of the past in terms of social inequalities and stereotypes of race, now embraced Mandela’s vision of a free society based on a demo-cratic, nonracial constitution.<p></p> <p></p> Yet Mandela’s legacy extends even beyond these great achievements. He had rescued South Africa’s international reputation from being a “polecat among nations” to a well-respected international partner that was a model of successful conflict resolution. He had played a role in bro-kering peace accords in the conflict-ridden countries of Burundi and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. On the world stage, Mandela had worked hard to foster peaceful relations between different peoples.<p></p> <p></p> Over and above all these achievements looms something intangible yet perhaps more effective: the example of a life spent struggling against adversity, imprisonment, and racism and yet marked by wonderful mag-nanimity, of a spirit not of revenge for past injustices but of reconcilia-tion and forgiveness to enable progress in building a better world. In this regard, the name Nelson Mandela has come to be synonymous with the endurance of the human spirit, of victory over evil.<p></p> <p></p> Archbishop Desmond Tutu remarked that, as Martin Luther King took the struggle for civil rights “beyond the civil rights era to what he called the poor people’s movements,” then so Mandela has become “a beacon of peace and hope for millions.” Nigerian writer and Nobel Laureate Wole Soyinka, a fellow fighter for human rights who also spent years in a politi-cal prison and is perhaps Africa’s leading playwright, described Mandela as a symbol of the spirit of humanity’s dialogue for a rainbow culture, a person of “unparalleled generosity of spirit.” African American writer Cornell West portrayed Mandela as “great exemplar of the grand demo-cratic tradition.” Former U.S. President Bill Clinton characterized Man-dela’s struggle as one purified by the severe trials he endured such that, as president, Mandela brought into government even his enemies, to try “to get all South Africans to make the same ‘long walk to freedom’ that has made his own life so extraordinary.”7<p></p>  
128	NELSON MANDELA<p></p> <p></p> Mandela’s bequest is not just political—in the form of South African’s successful democracy, or economic—in the form of a growing black renais-sance. The spirit of freedom enjoyed by South Africans today is no less significant for its intangible nature. This legacy is being realized practi-cally if modestly at a grassroots level through his charitable foundations such as the Nelson Mandela Foundation and the Nelson Mandela Chil-dren’s Fund. August 2007 saw the launch of the Nelson Mandela Institute for Education and Rural Development in South Africa’s impoverished Eastern Cape region. Backed by the Nelson Mandela Foundation and by Mandela’s old college, the University of Fort Hare, and South Africa’s Education Department, the institute aims to inject millions of dollars for a new rural education program and is just one manifestation of Mandela’s ongoing commitment to his country.<p></p> <p></p> For Mandela it has been a lifetime of struggle; there was “no easy walk to freedom”; it was truly a very “long walk to freedom.” To overcome the tremendous, seemingly insurmountable barriers in the way to this free-dom required a great movement of peoples, and great leaders. Mandela devoted his life to the ANC as the vehicle for the freedom of all South Africans. He could not have made it without them; they could not have made it without one such as him. His determination, brilliance, energy, and endurance, and above all his character, were major factors in secur-ing the end of apartheid and the gains of the New South Africa. As his longtime friend on Robben Island, Eddie Daniels, put it, Nelson Mandela “is quite simply one of the greatest persons in human history.”8<p></p> <p></p> NOTES<p></p> <p></p> 1.

   Preface<p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> A preface to the first edition of ‘Jane Eyre’ being unnec-essary, I gave none: this second edition demands a few words both of acknowledgment and miscellaneous remark.<p></p> <p></p> My thanks are due in three quarters.<p></p> <p></p> To the Public, for the indulgent ear it has inclined to a plain tale with few pretensions.<p></p> <p></p> To the Press, for the fair field its honest suffrage has opened to an obscure aspirant.<p></p> <p></p> To my Publishers, for the aid their tact, their energy, their practical sense and frank liberality have afforded an unknown and unrecommended Author.<p></p> <p></p> The Press and the Public are but vague personifications for me, and I must thank them in vague terms; but my Pub-lishers are definite: so are certain generous critics who have encouraged me as only large-hearted and high-minded men know how to encourage a struggling stranger; to them, i.e., to my Publishers and the select Reviewers, I say cordially, Gentlemen, I thank you from my heart.<p></p> <p></p> Having thus acknowledged what I owe those who have aided and approved me, I turn to another class; a small one, so far as I know, but not, therefore, to be overlooked. I mean the timorous or carping few who doubt the tendency of such books as ‘Jane Eyre:’ in whose eyes whatever is unusual is wrong; whose ears detect in each protest against bigotry—<p></p>  
<p></p>  	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
that parent of crime—an insult to piety, that regent of God on earth. I would suggest to such doubters certain obvious distinctions; I would remind them of certain simple truths.<p></p> <p></p> Conventionality is not morality. Self-righteousness is not religion. To attack the first is not to assail the last. To pluck the mask from the face of the Pharisee, is not to lift an impious hand to the Crown of Thorns.<p></p> <p></p> These things and deeds are diametrically opposed: they are as distinct as is vice from virtue. Men too often con-found them: they should not be confounded: appearance should not be mistaken for truth; narrow human doctrines, that only tend to elate and magnify a few, should not be substituted for the world-redeeming creed of Christ. There is—I repeat it—a difference; and it is a good, and not a bad action to mark broadly and clearly the line of separation between them.<p></p> <p></p> The world may not like to see these ideas dissevered, for it has been accustomed to blend them; finding it convenient to make external show pass for sterling worth—to let white-washed walls vouch for clean shrines. It may hate him who dares to scrutinise and expose—to rase the gilding, and show base metal under it—to penetrate the sepulchre, and reveal charnel relics: but hate as it will, it is indebted to him.<p></p> <p></p> Ahab did not like Micaiah, because he never prophesied good concerning him, but evil; probably he liked the sy-cophant son of Chenaannah better; yet might Ahab have escaped a bloody death, had he but stopped his ears to flat-tery, and opened them to faithful counsel.<p></p>

There is a man in our own days whose words are not framed to tickle delicate ears: who, to my thinking, comes before the great ones of society, much as the son of Imlah came before the throned Kings of Judah and Israel; and who speaks truth as deep, with a power as prophet-like and as vital—a mien as dauntless and as daring. Is the satirist of ‘Vanity Fair’ admired in high places? I cannot tell; but I think if some of those amongst whom he hurls the Greek fire of his sarcasm, and over whom he flashes the levin-brand of his denunciation, were to take his warnings in time—they or their seed might yet escape a fatal Rimoth-Gilead.<p></p> <p></p> Why have I alluded to this man? I have alluded to him, Reader, because I think I see in him an intellect profounder and more unique than his contemporaries have yet recog-nised; because I regard him as the first social regenerator of the day—as the very master of that working corps who would restore to rectitude the warped system of things; be-cause I think no commentator on his writings has yet found the comparison that suits him, the terms which rightly characterise his talent. They say he is like Fielding: they talk of his wit, humour, comic powers. He resembles Fielding as an eagle does a vulture: Fielding could stoop on carrion, but Thackeray never does. His wit is bright, his humour attrac-tive, but both bear the same relation to his serious genius that the mere lambent sheet-lightning playing under the edge of the summer-cloud does to the electric death-spark hid in its womb. Finally, I have alluded to Mr. Thackeray, because to him—if he will accept the tribute of a total stranger—I have dedicated this second edition of ‘JANE EYRE.’<p></p>

CURRER BELL.<p></p> <p></p> December 21st, 1847.<p></p> <p></p> NOTE TO THE THIRD EDITION<p></p> <p></p> I avail myself of the opportunity which a third edition of ‘Jane Eyre’ affords me, of again addressing a word to the Public, to explain that my claim to the title of novelist rests on this one work alone. If, therefore, the authorship of oth-er works of fiction has been attributed to me, an honour is awarded where it is not merited; and consequently, denied where it is justly due.<p></p> <p></p> This explanation will serve to rectify mistakes which may already have been made, and to prevent future errors.<p></p> <p></p> CURRER BELL.<p></p> <p></p> April 13th, 1848.<p></p>

Chapter I<p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> There was no possibility of taking a walk that day. We had been wandering, indeed, in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning; but since dinner (Mrs. Reed, when there was no company, dined early) the cold winter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre, and a rain so pen-etrating, that further out-door exercise was now out of the<p></p> <p></p> question.<p></p> <p></p> I was glad of it: I never liked long walks, especially on chilly afternoons: dreadful to me was the coming home in the raw twilight, with nipped fingers and toes, and a heart saddened by the chidings of Bessie, the nurse, and hum-bled by the consciousness of my physical inferiority to Eliza, John, and Georgiana Reed.<p></p> <p></p> The said Eliza, John, and Georgiana were now clustered round their mama in the drawing-room: she lay reclined on a sofa by the fireside, and with her darlings about her (for the time neither quarrelling nor crying) looked per-fectly happy. Me, she had dispensed from joining the group; saying, ‘She regretted to be under the necessity of keeping me at a distance; but that until she heard from Bes-sie, and could discover by her own observation, that I was endeavouring in good earnest to acquire a more sociable and childlike disposition, a more attractive and sprightly manner— something lighter, franker, more natural, as it<p></p>  
<p></p>  	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
were—she really must exclude me from privileges intended only for contented, happy, little children.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘What does Bessie say I have done?’ I asked.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Jane, I don’t like cavillers or questioners; besides, there is something truly forbidding in a child taking up her elders in that manner. Be seated somewhere; and until you can speak pleasantly, remain silent.’<p></p> <p></p> A breakfast-room adjoined the drawing-room, I slipped in there. It contained a bookcase: I soon possessed myself of a volume, taking care that it should be one stored with pictures. I mounted into the window-seat: gathering up my feet, I sat cross-legged, like a Turk; and, having drawn the red moreen curtain nearly close, I was shrined in double retirement.<p></p> <p></p> Folds of scarlet drapery shut in my view to the right hand; to the left were the clear panes of glass, protecting, but not separating me from the drear November day. At in-tervals, while turning over the leaves of my book, I studied the aspect of that winter afternoon. Afar, it offered a pale blank of mist and cloud; near a scene of wet lawn and storm-beat shrub, with ceaseless rain sweeping away wildly before a long and lamentable blast.<p></p> <p></p> I returned to my book—Bewick’s History of British Birds: the letterpress thereof I cared little for, generally speaking; and yet there were certain introductory pages that, child as I was, I could not pass quite as a blank. They were those which treat of the haunts of sea-fowl; of ‘the solitary rocks and promontories’ by them only inhabited; of the coast of Norway, studded with isles from its southern extremity, the<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com<p></p>  
Lindeness, or Naze, to the North Cape—<p></p> <p></p> ‘Where the Northern Ocean, in vast whirls, Boils round the naked, melancholy isles Of farthest Thule; and the Atlantic surge Pours in among the stormy Hebrides.’<p></p> <p></p> Nor could I pass unnoticed the suggestion of the bleak shores of Lapland, Siberia, Spitzbergen, Nova Zembla, Ice-land, Greenland, with ‘the vast sweep of the Arctic Zone, and those forlorn regions of dreary space,—that reservoir of frost and snow, where firm fields of ice, the accumula-tion of centuries of winters, glazed in Alpine heights above heights, surround the pole, and concentre the multiplied rigours of extreme cold.’ Of these death-white realms I formed an idea of my own: shadowy, like all the half-com-prehended notions that float dim through children’s brains, but strangely impressive. The words in these introductory pages connected themselves with the succeeding vignettes, and gave significance to the rock standing up alone in a sea of billow and spray; to the broken boat stranded on a deso-late coast; to the cold and ghastly moon glancing through bars of cloud at a wreck just sinking.<p></p> <p></p> I cannot tell what sentiment haunted the quite solitary churchyard, with its inscribed headstone; its gate, its two trees, its low horizon, girdled by a broken wall, and its new-ly-risen crescent, attesting the hour of eventide.<p></p> <p></p> The two ships becalmed on a torpid sea, I believed to be marine phantoms.<p></p>  
<p></p>  	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
The fiend pinning down the thief’s pack behind him, I passed over quickly: it was an object of terror.<p></p> <p></p> So was the black horned thing seated aloof on a rock, surveying a distant crowd surrounding a gallows.<p></p> <p></p> Each picture told a story; mysterious often to my un-developed understanding and imperfect feelings, yet ever profoundly interesting: as interesting as the tales Bessie sometimes narrated on winter evenings, when she chanced to be in good humour; and when, having brought her iron-ing-table to the nursery hearth, she allowed us to sit about it, and while she got up Mrs. Reed’s lace frills, and crimped her nightcap borders, fed our eager attention with passages of love and adventure taken from old fairy tales and other ballads; or (as at a later period I discovered) from the pages of Pamela, and Henry, Earl of Moreland.<p></p> <p></p> With Bewick on my knee, I was then happy: happy at least in my way. I feared nothing but interruption, and that came too soon. The breakfast-room door opened.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Boh! Madam Mope!’ cried the voice of John Reed; then he paused: he found the room apparently empty.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Where the dickens is she!’ he continued. ‘Lizzy! Georgy! (calling to his sisters) Joan is not here: tell mama she is run out into the rain—bad animal!’<p></p> <p></p> ‘It is well I drew the curtain,’ thought I; and I wished fer-vently he might not discover my hiding-place: nor would John Reed have found it out himself; he was not quick either of vision or conception; but Eliza just put her head in at the door, and said at once—<p></p> <p></p> ‘She is in the window-seat, to be sure, Jack.’<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com<p></p>  
And I came out immediately, for I trembled at the idea of being dragged forth by the said Jack.<p></p> <p></p> ‘What do you want?’ I asked, with awkward diffidence.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Say, ‘What do you want, Master Reed?’’ was the answer.<p></p> <p></p> ‘I want you to come here;’ and seating himself in an arm-chair, he intimated by a gesture that I was to approach and stand before him.<p></p> <p></p> John Reed was a schoolboy of fourteen years old; four years older than I, for I was but ten: large and stout for his age, with a dingy and unwholesome skin; thick lineaments in a spacious visage, heavy limbs and large extremities. He gorged himself habitually at table, which made him bilious, and gave him a dim and bleared eye and flabby cheeks. He ought now to have been at school; but his mama had taken him home for a month or two, ‘on account of his delicate health.’ Mr. Miles, the master, affirmed that he would do very well if he had fewer cakes and sweetmeats sent him from home; but the mother’s heart turned from an opinion so harsh, and inclined rather to the more refined idea that John’s sallowness was owing to over-application and, per-haps, to pining after home.<p></p> <p></p> John had not much affection for his mother and sisters, and an antipathy to me. He bullied and punished me; not two or three times in the week, nor once or twice in the day, but continually: every nerve I had feared him, and ev-ery morsel of flesh in my bones shrank when he came near. There were moments when I was bewildered by the terror he inspired, because I had no appeal whatever against ei-ther his menaces or his inflictions; the servants did not like<p></p>  
<p></p> 10	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
to offend their young master by taking my part against him, and Mrs. Reed was blind and deaf on the subject: she never saw him strike or heard him abuse me, though he did both now and then in her very presence, more frequently, how-ever, behind her back.<p></p> <p></p> Habitually obedient to John, I came up to his chair: he spent some three minutes in thrusting out his tongue at me as far as he could without damaging the roots: I knew he would soon strike, and while dreading the blow, I mused on the disgusting and ugly appearance of him who would presently deal it. I wonder if he read that notion in my face; for, all at once, without speaking, he struck suddenly and strongly. I tottered, and on regaining my equilibrium re-tired back a step or two from his chair.<p></p> <p></p> ‘That is for your impudence in answering mama awhile since,’ said he, ‘and for your sneaking way of getting behind curtains, and for the look you had in your eyes two minutes since, you rat!’<p></p> <p></p> Accustomed to John Reed’s abuse, I never had an idea of replying to it; my care was how to endure the blow which would certainly follow the insult.<p></p> <p></p> ‘What were you doing behind the curtain?’ he asked.<p></p> <p></p> ‘I was reading.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Show the book.’<p></p> <p></p> I returned to the window and fetched it thence.<p></p> <p></p> ‘You have no business to take our books; you are a de-pendent, mama says; you have no money; your father left you none; you ought to beg, and not to live here with gen-tlemen’s children like us, and eat the same meals we do, and<p></p>

wear clothes at our mama’s expense. Now, I’ll teach you to rummage my bookshelves: for they ARE mine; all the house belongs to me, or will do in a few years. Go and stand by the door, out of the way of the mirror and the windows.’<p></p> <p></p> I did so, not at first aware what was his intention; but when I saw him lift and poise the book and stand in act to hurl it, I instinctively started aside with a cry of alarm: not soon enough, however; the volume was flung, it hit me, and I fell, striking my head against the door and cutting it. The cut bled, the pain was sharp: my terror had passed its cli-max; other feelings succeeded.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Wicked and cruel boy!’ I said. ‘You are like a murder-er—you are like a slave-driver—you are like the Roman emperors!’<p></p> <p></p> I had read Goldsmith’s History of Rome, and had formed my opinion of Nero, Caligula, &c. Also I had drawn paral-lels in silence, which I never thought thus to have declared aloud.<p></p> <p></p> ‘What! what!’ he cried. ‘Did she say that to me? Did you hear her, Eliza and Georgiana? Won’t I tell mama? but first—‘<p></p> <p></p> He ran headlong at me: I felt him grasp my hair and my shoulder: he had closed with a desperate thing. I really saw in him a tyrant, a murderer. I felt a drop or two of blood from my head trickle down my neck, and was sensible of somewhat pungent suffering: these sensations for the time predominated over fear, and I received him in frantic sort. I don’t very well know what I did with my hands, but he called me ‘Rat! Rat!’ and bellowed out aloud. Aid was near<p></p>  
<p></p> 12	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
him: Eliza and Georgiana had run for Mrs. Reed, who was<p></p> <p></p> gone upstairs: she now came upon the scene, followed by<p></p> <p></p> Bessie and her maid Abbot. We were parted: I heard the words—<p></p> <p></p> ‘Dear! dear! What a fury to fly at Master John!’ ‘Did ever anybody see such a picture of passion!’ Then Mrs. Reed subjoined—<p></p> <p></p> ‘Take her away to the red-room, and lock her in there.’ Four hands were immediately laid upon me, and I was borne upstairs.<p></p>  
<p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	13<p></p>  
Chapter II<p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> I resisted all the way: a new thing for me, and a circum-stance which greatly strengthened the bad opinion Bessie and Miss Abbot were disposed to entertain of me. The fact is, I was a trifle beside myself; or rather OUT of myself, as the French would say: I was conscious that a moment’s mu-tiny had already rendered me liable to strange penalties, and, like any other rebel slave, I felt resolved, in my desper-<p></p> <p></p> ation, to go all lengths.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Hold her arms, Miss Abbot: she’s like a mad cat.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘For shame! for shame!’ cried the lady’s-maid. ‘What shocking conduct, Miss Eyre, to strike a young gentleman, your benefactress’s son! Your young master.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Master! How is he my master? Am I a servant?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘No; you are less than a servant, for you do nothing for your keep. There, sit down, and think over your wicked-ness.’<p></p> <p></p> They had got me by this time into the apartment indi-cated by Mrs. Reed, and had thrust me upon a stool: my impulse was to rise from it like a spring; their two pair of hands arrested me instantly.<p></p> <p></p> ‘If you don’t sit still, you must be tied down,’ said Bessie. ‘Miss Abbot, lend me your garters; she would break mine directly.’<p></p> <p></p> Miss Abbot turned to divest a stout leg of the necessary<p></p>  
<p></p> 14	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
ligature. This preparation for bonds, and the additional ig-nominy it inferred, took a little of the excitement out of me.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Don’t take them off,’ I cried; ‘I will not stir.’<p></p> <p></p> In guarantee whereof, I attached myself to my seat by my hands.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Mind you don’t,’ said Bessie; and when she had ascer-tained that I was really subsiding, she loosened her hold of me; then she and Miss Abbot stood with folded arms, look-ing darkly and doubtfully on my face, as incredulous of my sanity.<p></p> <p></p> ‘She never did so before,’ at last said Bessie, turning to the Abigail.<p></p> <p></p> ‘But it was always in her,’ was the reply. ‘I’ve told Missis often my opinion about the child, and Missis agreed with me. She’s an underhand little thing: I never saw a girl of her age with so much cover.’<p></p> <p></p> Bessie answered not; but ere long, addressing me, she said—‘You ought to be aware, Miss, that you are under ob-ligations to Mrs. Reed: she keeps you: if she were to turn you off, you would have to go to the poorhouse.’<p></p> <p></p> I had nothing to say to these words: they were not new to me: my very first recollections of existence included hints of the same kind. This reproach of my dependence had become a vague sing-song in my ear: very painful and crushing, but only half intelligible. Miss Abbot joined in—<p></p> <p></p> ‘And you ought not to think yourself on an equality with the Misses Reed and Master Reed, because Missis kindly al-lows you to be brought up with them. They will have a great deal of money, and you will have none: it is your place to be<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	15<p></p>  
humble, and to try to make yourself agreeable to them.’ ‘What we tell you is for your good,’ added Bessie, in no<p></p> <p></p> harsh voice, ‘you should try to be useful and pleasant, then, perhaps, you would have a home here; but if you become passionate and rude, Missis will send you away, I am sure.’ ‘Besides,’ said Miss Abbot, ‘God will punish her: He might strike her dead in the midst of her tantrums, and then where would she go? Come, Bessie, we will leave her: I wouldn’t have her heart for anything. Say your prayers, Miss Eyre, when you are by yourself; for if you don’t re-pent, something bad might be permitted to come down the<p></p> <p></p> chimney and fetch you away.’<p></p> <p></p> They went, shutting the door, and locking it behind them.<p></p> <p></p> The red-room was a square chamber, very seldom slept in, I might say never, indeed, unless when a chance influx of visitors at Gateshead Hall rendered it necessary to turn to account all the accommodation it contained: yet it was one of the largest and stateliest chambers in the mansion. A bed supported on massive pillars of mahogany, hung with curtains of deep red damask, stood out like a tabernacle in the centre; the two large windows, with their blinds always drawn down, were half shrouded in festoons and falls of similar drapery; the carpet was red; the table at the foot of the bed was covered with a crimson cloth; the walls were a soft fawn colour with a blush of pink in it; the wardrobe, the toilet-table, the chairs were of darkly polished old ma-hogany. Out of these deep surrounding shades rose high, and glared white, the piled-up mattresses and pillows of the<p></p>  
<p></p> 16	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
bed, spread with a snowy Marseilles counterpane. Scarcely less prominent was an ample cushioned easy- chair near the head of the bed, also white, with a footstool before it; and looking, as I thought, like a pale throne.<p></p> <p></p> This room was chill, because it seldom had a fire; it was silent, because remote from the nursery and kitchen; sol-emn, because it was known to be so seldom entered. The house-maid alone came here on Saturdays, to wipe from the mirrors and the furniture a week’s quiet dust: and Mrs. Reed herself, at far intervals, visited it to review the con-tents of a certain secret drawer in the wardrobe, where were stored divers parchments, her jewel-casket, and a miniature of her deceased husband; and in those last words lies the secret of the red-room—the spell which kept it so lonely in spite of its grandeur.<p></p> <p></p> Mr. Reed had been dead nine years: it was in this cham-ber he breathed his last; here he lay in state; hence his coffin was borne by the undertaker’s men; and, since that day, a sense of dreary consecration had guarded it from frequent intrusion.<p></p> <p></p> My seat, to which Bessie and the bitter Miss Abbot had left me riveted, was a low ottoman near the marble chim-ney-piece; the bed rose before me; to my right hand there was the high, dark wardrobe, with subdued, broken re-flections varying the gloss of its panels; to my left were the muffled windows; a great looking-glass between them re-peated the vacant majesty of the bed and room. I was not quite sure whether they had locked the door; and when I dared move, I got up and went to see. Alas! yes: no jail was<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	17<p></p>  
ever more secure. Returning, I had to cross before the look-ing-glass; my fascinated glance involuntarily explored the depth it revealed. All looked colder and darker in that vi-sionary hollow than in reality: and the strange little figure there gazing at me, with a white face and arms specking the gloom, and glittering eyes of fear moving where all else was still, had the effect of a real spirit: I thought it like one of the tiny phantoms, half fairy, half imp, Bessie’s evening stories represented as coming out of lone, ferny dells in moors, and appearing before the eyes of belated travellers. I returned to my stool.<p></p> <p></p> Superstition was with me at that moment; but it was not yet her hour for complete victory: my blood was still warm; the mood of the revolted slave was still bracing me with its bitter vigour; I had to stem a rapid rush of retrospective thought before I quailed to the dismal present.<p></p> <p></p> All John Reed’s violent tyrannies, all his sisters’ proud indifference, all his mother’s aversion, all the servants’ par-tiality, turned up in my disturbed mind like a dark deposit in a turbid well. Why was I always suffering, always brow-beaten, always accused, for ever condemned? Why could I never please? Why was it useless to try to win any one’s fa-vour? Eliza, who was headstrong and selfish, was respected. Georgiana, who had a spoiled temper, a very acrid spite, a captious and insolent carriage, was universally indulged. Her beauty, her pink cheeks and golden curls, seemed to give delight to all who looked at her, and to purchase indemnity for every fault. John no one thwarted, much less punished; though he twisted the necks of the pigeons, killed the little<p></p>  
<p></p> 18	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
pea-chicks, set the dogs at the sheep, stripped the hothouse vines of their fruit, and broke the buds off the choicest plants in the conservatory: he called his mother ‘old girl,’ too; sometimes reviled her for her dark skin, similar to his own; bluntly disregarded her wishes; not unfrequently tore and spoiled her silk attire; and he was still ‘her own darling.’ I dared commit no fault: I strove to fulfil every duty; and I was termed naughty and tiresome, sullen and sneaking, from morning to noon, and from noon to night.<p></p> <p></p> My head still ached and bled with the blow and fall I had received: no one had reproved John for wantonly striking me; and because I had turned against him to avert farther irrational violence, I was loaded with general opprobrium.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Unjust!—unjust!’ said my reason, forced by the agonis-ing stimulus into precocious though transitory power: and Resolve, equally wrought up, instigated some strange expe-dient to achieve escape from insupportable oppression—as running away, or, if that could not be effected, never eating or drinking more, and letting myself die.<p></p> <p></p> What a consternation of soul was mine that dreary after-noon! How all my brain was in tumult, and all my heart in insurrection! Yet in what darkness, what dense ignorance, was the mental battle fought! I could not answer the cease-less inward question—WHY I thus suffered; now, at the distance of—I will not say how many years, I see it clearly.<p></p> <p></p> I was a discord in Gateshead Hall: I was like nobody there; I had nothing in harmony with Mrs. Reed or her chil-dren, or her chosen vassalage. If they did not love me, in fact, as little did I love them. They were not bound to regard<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	19<p></p>  
with affection a thing that could not sympathise with one amongst them; a heterogeneous thing, opposed to them in temperament, in capacity, in propensities; a useless thing, incapable of serving their interest, or adding to their plea-sure; a noxious thing, cherishing the germs of indignation at their treatment, of contempt of their judgment. I know that had I been a sanguine, brilliant, careless, exacting, handsome, romping child—though equally dependent and friendless—Mrs. Reed would have endured my presence more complacently; her children would have entertained for me more of the cordiality of fellow-feeling; the servants would have been less prone to make me the scapegoat of the nursery.<p></p> <p></p> Daylight began to forsake the red-room; it was past four o’clock, and the beclouded afternoon was tending to drear twilight. I heard the rain still beating continuously on the staircase window, and the wind howling in the grove be-hind the hall; I grew by degrees cold as a stone, and then my courage sank. My habitual mood of humiliation, self-doubt, forlorn depression, fell damp on the embers of my decaying ire. All said I was wicked, and perhaps I might be so; what thought had I been but just conceiving of starving myself to death? That certainly was a crime: and was I fit to die? Or was the vault under the chancel of Gateshead Church an in-viting bourne? In such vault I had been told did Mr. Reed lie buried; and led by this thought to recall his idea, I dwelt on it with gathering dread. I could not remember him; but I knew that he was my own uncle—my mother’s brother— that he had taken me when a parentless infant to his house;<p></p>  
<p></p> 20	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
and that in his last moments he had required a promise of Mrs. Reed that she would rear and maintain me as one of her own children. Mrs. Reed probably considered she had kept this promise; and so she had, I dare say, as well as her nature would permit her; but how could she really like an interloper not of her race, and unconnected with her, after her husband’s death, by any tie? It must have been most irk-some to find herself bound by a hard-wrung pledge to stand in the stead of a parent to a strange child she could not love, and to see an uncongenial alien permanently intruded on her own family group.<p></p> <p></p> A singular notion dawned upon me. I doubted not—nev-er doubted— that if Mr. Reed had been alive he would have treated me kindly; and now, as I sat looking at the white bed and overshadowed walls— occasionally also turning a fascinated eye towards the dimly gleaning mirror—I began to recall what I had heard of dead men, troubled in their graves by the violation of their last wishes, revisiting the earth to punish the perjured and avenge the oppressed; and I thought Mr. Reed’s spirit, harassed by the wrongs of his sister’s child, might quit its abode—whether in the church vault or in the unknown world of the departed—and rise before me in this chamber. I wiped my tears and hushed my sobs, fearful lest any sign of violent grief might waken a preternatural voice to comfort me, or elicit from the gloom some haloed face, bending over me with strange pity. This idea, consolatory in theory, I felt would be terrible if realised: with all my might I endeavoured to stifle itI endeavoured to be firm. Shaking my hair from my eyes, I lifted my head and<p></p>

tried to look boldly round the dark room; at this moment a light gleamed on the wall. Was it, I asked myself, a ray from the moon penetrating some aperture in the blind? No; moonlight was still, and this stirred; while I gazed, it glided up to the ceiling and quivered over my head. I can now con-jecture readily that this streak of light was, in all likelihood, a gleam from a lantern carried by some one across the lawn: but then, prepared as my mind was for horror, shaken as my nerves were by agitation, I thought the swift darting beam was a herald of some coming vision from another world. My heart beat thick, my head grew hot; a sound filled my ears, which I deemed the rushing of wings; something seemed near me; I was oppressed, suffocated: endurance broke down; I rushed to the door and shook the lock in desperate effort. Steps came running along the outer passage; the key turned, Bessie and Abbot entered.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Miss Eyre, are you ill?’ said Bessie.<p></p> <p></p> ‘What a dreadful noise! it went quite through me!’ ex-claimed Abbot.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Take me out! Let me go into the nursery!’ was my cry. ‘What for? Are you hurt? Have you seen something?’<p></p> <p></p> again demanded Bessie.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Oh! I saw a light, and I thought a ghost would come.’ I had now got hold of Bessie’s hand, and she did not snatch it from me.<p></p> <p></p> ‘She has screamed out on purpose,’ declared Abbot, in some disgust. ‘And what a scream! If she had been in great pain one would have excused it, but she only wanted to bring us all here: I know her naughty tricks.’<p></p>  
<p></p> 22	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
‘What is all this?’ demanded another voice peremptorily; and Mrs. Reed came along the corridor, her cap flying wide, her gown rustling stormily. ‘Abbot and Bessie, I believe I gave orders that Jane Eyre should be left in the red-room till I came to her myself.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Miss Jane screamed so loud, ma’am,’ pleaded Bessie. ‘Let her go,’ was the only answer. ‘Loose Bessie’s hand,<p></p> <p></p> child: you cannot succeed in getting out by these means, be assured. I abhor artifice, particularly in children; it is my duty to show you that tricks will not answer: you will now stay here an hour longer, and it is only on condition of per-fect submission and stillness that I shall liberate you then.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘O aunt! have pity! Forgive me! I cannot endure it—let me be punished some other way! I shall be killed if—‘<p></p> <p></p> ‘Silence! This violence is all most repulsive:’ and so, no doubt, she felt it. I was a precocious actress in her eyes; she sincerely looked on me as a compound of virulent passions, mean spirit, and dangerous duplicity.<p></p> <p></p> Bessie and Abbot having retreated, Mrs. Reed, impatient of my now frantic anguish and wild sobs, abruptly thrust me back and locked me in, without farther parley. I heard her sweeping away; and soon after she was gone, I suppose I had a species of fit: unconsciousness closed the scene.<p></p>

Chapter III<p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> The next thing I remember is, waking up with a feeling as if I had had a frightful nightmare, and seeing before me a terrible red glare, crossed with thick black bars. I heard<p></p> <p></p> voices, too, speaking with a hollow sound, and as if muf-fled by a rush of wind or water: agitation, uncertainty, and an all-predominating sense of terror confused my faculties. Ere long, I became aware that some one was handling me; lifting me up and supporting me in a sitting posture, and that more tenderly than I had ever been raised or upheld before. I rested my head against a pillow or an arm, and felt easy.<p></p> <p></p> In five minutes more the cloud of bewilderment dis-solved: I knew quite well that I was in my own bed, and that the red glare was the nursery fire. It was night: a candle burnt on the table; Bessie stood at the bed-foot with a basin in her hand, and a gentleman sat in a chair near my pillow, leaning over me.<p></p> <p></p> I felt an inexpressible relief, a soothing conviction of pro-tection and security, when I knew that there was a stranger in the room, an individual not belonging to Gateshead., and not related to Mrs. Reed. Turning from Bessie (though her presence was far less obnoxious to me than that of Abbot, for instance, would have been), I scrutinised the face of the gentleman: I knew him; it was Mr. Lloyd, an apothecary,<p></p>  
<p></p> 24	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
sometimes called in by Mrs. Reed when the servants were ailing: for herself and the children she employed a physi-cian.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Well, who am I?’ he asked.<p></p> <p></p> I pronounced his name, offering him at the same time my hand: he took it, smiling and saying, ‘We shall do very well by-and-by.’ Then he laid me down, and addressing Bes-sie, charged her to be very careful that I was not disturbed during the night. Having given some further directions, and intimates that he should call again the next day, he de-parted; to my grief: I felt so sheltered and befriended while he sat in the chair near my pillow; and as he closed the door after him, all the room darkened and my heart again sank: inexpressible sadness weighed it down.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Do you feel as if you should sleep, Miss?’ asked Bessie, rather softly.<p></p> <p></p> Scarcely dared I answer her; for I feared the next sen-tence might be rough. ‘I will try.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Would you like to drink, or could you eat anything?’ ‘No, thank you, Bessie.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Then I think I shall go to bed, for it is past twelve o’clock; but you may call me if you want anything in the night.’<p></p> <p></p> Wonderful civility this! It emboldened me to ask a ques-tion.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Bessie, what is the matter with me? Am I ill?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘You fell sick, I suppose, in the red-room with crying; you’ll be better soon, no doubt.’<p></p> <p></p> Bessie went into the housemaid’s apartment, which was near. I heard her say—<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	25<p></p>  
‘Sarah, come and sleep with me in the nursery; I daren’t for my life be alone with that poor child to-night: she might die; it’s such a strange thing she should have that fit: I won-der if she saw anything. Missis was rather too hard.’<p></p> <p></p> Sarah came back with her; they both went to bed; they were whispering together for half-an-hour before they fell asleep. I caught scraps of their conversation, from which I was able only too distinctly to infer the main subject dis-cussed.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Something passed her, all dressed in white, and van-ished’—‘A great black dog behind him’—‘Three loud raps on the chamber door’—‘A light in the churchyard just over his grave,’ &c. &c.<p></p> <p></p> At last both slept: the fire and the candle went out. For me, the watches of that long night passed in ghastly wake-fulness; strained by dread: such dread as children only can feel.<p></p> <p></p> No severe or prolonged bodily illness followed this in-cident of the red-room; it only gave my nerves a shock of which I feel the reverberation to this day. Yes, Mrs. Reed, to you I owe some fearful pangs of mental suffering, but I ought to forgive you, for you knew not what you did: while rending my heart-strings, you thought you were only up-rooting my bad propensities.<p></p> <p></p> Next day, by noon, I was up and dressed, and sat wrapped in a shawl by the nursery hearth. I felt physically weak and broken down: but my worse ailment was an unutterable wretchedness of mind: a wretchedness which kept draw-ing from me silent tears; no sooner had I wiped one salt<p></p>  
<p></p> 26	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
drop from my cheek than another followed. Yet, I thought, I ought to have been happy, for none of the Reeds were there, they were all gone out in the carriage with their mama. Ab-bot, too, was sewing in another room, and Bessie, as she moved hither and thither, putting away toys and arrang-ing drawers, addressed to me every now and then a word of unwonted kindness. This state of things should have been to me a paradise of peace, accustomed as I was to a life of ceaseless reprimand and thankless fagging; but, in fact, my racked nerves were now in such a state that no calm could soothe, and no pleasure excite them agreeably.<p></p> <p></p> Bessie had been down into the kitchen, and she brought up with her a tart on a certain brightly painted china plate, whose bird of paradise, nestling in a wreath of convolvuli and rosebuds, had been wont to stir in me a most enthu-siastic sense of admiration; and which plate I had often petitioned to be allowed to take in my hand in order to ex-amine it more closely, but had always hitherto been deemed unworthy of such a privilege. This precious vessel was now placed on my knee, and I was cordially invited to eat the circlet of delicate pastry upon it. Vain favour! coming, like most other favours long deferred and often wished for, too late! I could not eat the tart; and the plumage of the bird, the tints of the flowers, seemed strangely faded: I put both plate and tart away. Bessie asked if I would have a book: the word BOOK acted as a transient stimulus, and I begged her to fetch Gulliver’s Travels from the library. This book I had again and again perused with delight. I considered it a nar-rative of facts, and discovered in it a vein of interest deeper<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	27<p></p>  
than what I found in fairy tales: for as to the elves, having sought them in vain among foxglove leaves and bells, un-der mushrooms and beneath the ground-ivy mantling old wall-nooks, I had at length made up my mind to the sad truth, that they were all gone out of England to some sav-age country where the woods were wilder and thicker, and the population more scant; whereas, Lilliput and Brobdig-nag being, in my creed, solid parts of the earth’s surface, I doubted not that I might one day, by taking a long voyage, see with my own eyes the little fields, houses, and trees, the diminutive people, the tiny cows, sheep, and birds of the one realm; and the corn-fields forest-high, the mighty mas-tiffs, the monster cats, the tower-like men and women, of the other. Yet, when this cherished volume was now placed in my hand—when I turned over its leaves, and sought in its marvellous pictures the charm I had, till now, never failed to find—all was eerie and dreary; the giants were gaunt goblins, the pigmies malevolent and fearful imps, Gulliver a most desolate wanderer in most dread and dangerous re-gions. I closed the book, which I dared no longer peruse, and put it on the table, beside the untasted tart.<p></p> <p></p> Bessie had now finished dusting and tidying the room, and having washed her hands, she opened a certain little drawer, full of splendid shreds of silk and satin, and began making a new bonnet for Georgiana’s doll. Meantime she sang: her song was—<p></p> <p></p> ‘In the days when we went gipsying, A long time ago.’<p></p> <p></p> I had often heard the song before, and always with live-ly delight; for Bessie had a sweet voice,—at least, I thought<p></p>  
<p></p> 28	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
so. But now, though her voice was still sweet, I found in its melody an indescribable sadness. Sometimes, preoccupied with her work, she sang the refrain very low, very linger-ingly; ‘A long time ago’ came out like the saddest cadence of a funeral hymn. She passed into another ballad, this time a really doleful one.<p></p> <p></p> ‘My feet they are sore, and my limbs they are weary; Long is the way, and the mountains are wild; Soon will the twilight close moonless and dreary Over the path of the poor orphan child.<p></p> <p></p> Why did they send me so far and so lonely,<p></p> <p></p> Up where the moors spread and grey rocks are piled?<p></p> <p></p> Men are hard-hearted, and kind angels only<p></p> <p></p> Watch o’er the steps of a poor orphan child.<p></p> <p></p> Yet distant and soft the night breeze is blowing,<p></p> <p></p> Clouds there are none, and clear stars beam mild,<p></p> <p></p> God, in His mercy, protection is showing,<p></p> <p></p> Comfort and hope to the poor orphan child.<p></p> <p></p> Ev’n should I fall o’er the broken bridge passing,<p></p> <p></p> Or stray in the marshes, by false lights beguiled,<p></p> <p></p> Still will my Father, with promise and blessing,<p></p> <p></p> Take to His bosom the poor orphan child.<p></p> <p></p> There is a thought that for strength should avail me, Though both of shelter and kindred despoiled;<p></p>

Heaven is a home, and a rest will not fail me; God is a friend to the poor orphan child.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Come, Miss Jane, don’t cry,’ said Bessie as she finished. She might as well have said to the fire, ‘don’t burn!’ but how could she divine the morbid suffering to which I was a prey? In the course of the morning Mr. Lloyd came again.<p></p> <p></p> ‘What, already up!’ said he, as he entered the nursery. ‘Well, nurse, how is she?’<p></p> <p></p> Bessie answered that I was doing very well.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Then she ought to look more cheerful. Come here, Miss Jane: your name is Jane, is it not?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Yes, sir, Jane Eyre.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Well, you have been crying, Miss Jane Eyre; can you tell me what about? Have you any pain?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘No, sir.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Oh! I daresay she is crying because she could not go out with Missis in the carriage,’ interposed Bessie.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Surely not! why, she is too old for such pettishness.’<p></p> <p></p> I thought so too; and my self-esteem being wounded by the false charge, I answered promptly, ‘I never cried for such a thing in my life: I hate going out in the carriage. I cry because I am miserable.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Oh fie, Miss!’ said Bessie.<p></p> <p></p> The good apothecary appeared a little puzzled. I was standing before him; he fixed his eyes on me very steadily: his eyes were small and grey; not very bright, but I dare say I should think them shrewd now: he had a hard-featured yet good-natured looking face. Having considered me at<p></p>  
<p></p> 30	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
leisure, he said—<p></p> <p></p> ‘What made you ill yesterday?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘She had a fall,’ said Bessie, again putting in her word. ‘Fall! why, that is like a baby again! Can’t she manage to<p></p> <p></p> walk at her age? She must be eight or nine years old.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘I was knocked down,’ was the blunt explanation, jerked out of me by another pang of mortified pride; ‘but that did not make me ill,’ I added; while Mr. Lloyd helped himself to a pinch of snuff.<p></p> <p></p> As he was returning the box to his waistcoat pocket, a loud bell rang for the servants’ dinner; he knew what it was. ‘That’s for you, nurse,’ said he; ‘you can go down; I’ll give Miss Jane a lecture till you come back.’<p></p> <p></p> Bessie would rather have stayed, but she was obliged to go, because punctuality at meals was rigidly enforced at Gateshead Hall.<p></p> <p></p> ‘The fall did not make you ill; what did, then?’ pursued Mr. Lloyd when Bessie was gone.<p></p> <p></p> ‘I was shut up in a room where there is a ghost till after dark.’<p></p> <p></p> I saw Mr. Lloyd smile and frown at the same time. ‘Ghost! What, you are a baby after all! You are afraid of<p></p> <p></p> ghosts?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Of Mr. Reed’s ghost I am: he died in that room, and was laid out there. Neither Bessie nor any one else will go into it at night, if they can help it; and it was cruel to shut me up alone without a candle,—so cruel that I think I shall never forget it.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Nonsense! And is it that makes you so miserable? Are<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	31<p></p>  
you afraid now in daylight?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘No: but night will come again before long: and besides,— I am unhappy,—very unhappy, for other things.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘What other things? Can you tell me some of them?’ How much I wished to reply fully to this question! How<p></p> <p></p> difficult it was to frame any answer! Children can feel, but they cannot analyse their feelings; and if the analysis is par-tially effected in thought, they know not how to express the result of the process in words. Fearful, however, of losing this first and only opportunity of relieving my grief by im-parting it, I, after a disturbed pause, contrived to frame a meagre, though, as far as it went, true response.<p></p> <p></p> ‘For one thing, I have no father or mother, brothers or sisters.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘You have a kind aunt and cousins.’<p></p> <p></p> Again I paused; then bunglingly enounced—<p></p> <p></p> ‘But John Reed knocked me down, and my aunt shut me up in the red- room.’<p></p> <p></p> Mr. Lloyd a second time produced his snuff-box.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Don’t you think Gateshead Hall a very beautiful house?’ asked he. ‘Are you not very thankful to have such a fine place to live at?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘It is not my house, sir; and Abbot says I have less right to be here than a servant.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Pooh! you can’t be silly enough to wish to leave such a splendid place?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘If I had anywhere else to go, I should be glad to leave it; but I can never get away from Gateshead till I am a wom-an.’<p></p>  
<p></p> 32	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
‘Perhaps you may—who knows? Have you any relations besides Mrs. Reed?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘I think not, sir.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘None belonging to your father?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘I don’t know. I asked Aunt Reed once, and she said pos-sibly I might have some poor, low relations called Eyre, but she knew nothing about them.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘If you had such, would you like to go to them?’<p></p> <p></p> I reflected. Poverty looks grim to grown people; still more so to children: they have not much idea of industri-ous, working, respectable poverty; they think of the word only as connected with ragged clothes, scanty food, fireless grates, rude manners, and debasing vices: poverty for me was synonymous with degradation.<p></p> <p></p> ‘No; I should not like to belong to poor people,’ was my reply.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Not even if they were kind to you?’<p></p> <p></p> I shook my head: I could not see how poor people had the means of being kind; and then to learn to speak like them, to adopt their manners, to be uneducated, to grow up like one of the poor women I saw sometimes nursing their children or washing their clothes at the cottage doors of the village of Gateshead: no, I was not heroic enough to pur-chase liberty at the price of caste.<p></p> <p></p> ‘But are your relatives so very poor? Are they working people?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘I cannot tell; Aunt. Reed says if I have any, they must be a beggarly set: I should not like to go a begging.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Would you like to go to school?’<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	33<p></p>  
Again I reflected: I scarcely knew what school was: Bes-sie sometimes spoke of it as a place where young ladies sat in the stocks, wore backboards, and were expected to be ex-ceedingly genteel and precise: John Reed hated his school, and abused his master; but John Reed’s tastes were no rule for mine, and if Bessie’s accounts of school-discipline (gath-ered from the young ladies of a family where she had lived before coming to Gateshead) were somewhat appalling, her details of certain accomplishments attained by these same young ladies were, I thought, equally attractive. She boasted of beautiful paintings of landscapes and flowers by them executed; of songs they could sing and pieces they could play, of purses they could net, of French books they could translate; till my spirit was moved to emulation as I listened. Besides, school would be a complete change: it implied a long journey, an entire separation from Gateshead, an en-trance into a new life.<p></p> <p></p> ‘I should indeed like to go to school,’ was the audible con-clusion of my musings.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Well, well! who knows what may happen?’ said Mr. Lloyd, as he got up. ‘The child ought to have change of air and scene,’ he added, speaking to himself; ‘nerves not in a good state.’<p></p> <p></p> Bessie now returned; at the same moment the carriage was heard rolling up the gravel-walk.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Is that your mistress, nurse?’ asked Mr. Lloyd. ‘I should like to speak to her before I go.’<p></p> <p></p> Bessie invited him to walk into the breakfast-room, and led the way out. In the interview which followed between<p></p>  
<p></p> 34	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
him and Mrs. Reed, I presume, from after-occurrences, that the apothecary ventured to recommend my being sent to school; and the recommendation was no doubt readily enough adopted; for as Abbot said, in discussing the subject with Bessie when both sat sewing in the nursery one night, after I was in bed, and, as they thought, asleep, ‘Missis was, she dared say, glad enough to get rid of such a tire-some, ill- conditioned child, who always looked as if she were watching everybody, and scheming plots underhand.’ Abbot, I think, gave me credit for being a sort of infantine Guy Fawkes.<p></p> <p></p> On that same occasion I learned, for the first time, from Miss Abbot’s communications to Bessie, that my father had been a poor clergyman; that my mother had married him against the wishes of her friends, who considered the match beneath her; that my grandfather Reed was so irritated at her disobedience, he cut her off without a shilling; that after my mother and father had been married a year, the latter caught the typhus fever while visiting among the poor of a large manufacturing town where his curacy was situated, and where that disease was then prevalent: that my mother took the infection from him, and both died within a month of each other.<p></p> <p></p> Bessie, when she heard this narrative, sighed and said, ‘Poor Miss Jane is to be pitied, too, Abbot.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Yes,’ responded Abbot; ‘if she were a nice, pretty child, one might compassionate her forlornness; but one really cannot care for such a little toad as that.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Not a great deal, to be sure,’ agreed Bessie: ‘at any rate, a<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	35<p></p>  
beauty like Miss Georgiana would be more moving in the same condition.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Yes, I doat on Miss Georgiana!’ cried the fervent Abbot. ‘Little darling!—with her long curls and her blue eyes, and such a sweet colour as she has; just as if she were painted!— Bessie, I could fancy a Welsh rabbit for supper.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘So could I—with a roast onion. Come, we’ll go down.’ They went.<p></p>  
<p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> 36	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
Chapter IV<p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> From my discourse with Mr. Lloyd, and from the above reported conference between Bessie and Abbot, I gath-ered enough of hope to suffice as a motive for wishing to get well: a change seemed near,I desired and waited it in silence. It tarried, however: days and weeks passed: I had regained my normal state of health, but no new allusion was made to the subject over which I brooded. Mrs. Reed surveyed me at times with a severe eye, but seldom addressed me: since my illness, she had drawn a more marked line of separation than ever between me and her own children; appointing me a small closet to sleep in by myself, condemning me to take my meals alone, and pass all my time in the nursery, while my cousins were constantly in the drawing-room. Not a hint, however, did she drop about sending me to school: still I felt an instinctive certainty that she would not long endure me under the same roof with her; for her glance, now more than ever, when turned on me, expressed an insuperable<p></p> <p></p> and rooted aversion.<p></p> <p></p> Eliza and Georgiana, evidently acting according to or-ders, spoke to me as little as possible: John thrust his tongue in his cheek whenever he saw me, and once attempted chas-tisement; but as I instantly turned against him, roused by the same sentiment of deep ire and desperate revolt which had stirred my corruption before, he thought it better to<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	37<p></p>  
desist, and ran from me tittering execrations, and vowing I had burst his nose. I had indeed levelled at that promi-nent feature as hard a blow as my knuckles could inflict; and when I saw that either that or my look daunted him, I had the greatest inclination to follow up my advantage to purpose; but he was already with his mama. I heard him in a blubbering tone commence the tale of how ‘that nasty Jane Eyre’ had flown at him like a mad cat: he was stopped rather harshly—<p></p> <p></p> ‘Don’t talk to me about her, John: I told you not to go near her; she is not worthy of notice; I do not choose that either you or your sisters should associate with her.’<p></p> <p></p> Here, leaning over the banister, I cried out suddenly, and without at all deliberating on my words—<p></p> <p></p> ‘They are not fit to associate with me.’<p></p> <p></p> Mrs. Reed was rather a stout woman; but, on hearing this strange and audacious declaration, she ran nimbly up the stair, swept me like a whirlwind into the nursery, and crushing me down on the edge of my crib, dared me in an emphatic voice to rise from that place, or utter one syllable during the remainder of the day.<p></p> <p></p> ‘What would Uncle Reed say to you, if he were alive?’ was my scarcely voluntary demand. I say scarcely voluntary, for it seemed as if my tongue pronounced words without my will consenting to their utterance: something spoke out of me over which I had no control.<p></p> <p></p> ‘What?’ said Mrs. Reed under her breath: her usually cold composed grey eye became troubled with a look like fear; she took her hand from my arm, and gazed at me as if<p></p>  
<p></p> 38	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
she really did not know whether I were child or fiend. I was now in for it.<p></p> <p></p> ‘My Uncle Reed is in heaven, and can see all you do and think; and so can papa and mama: they know how you shut me up all day long, and how you wish me dead.’<p></p> <p></p> Mrs. Reed soon rallied her spirits: she shook me most soundly, she boxed both my ears, and then left me without a word. Bessie supplied the hiatus by a homily of an hour’s length, in which she proved beyond a doubt that I was the most wicked and abandoned child ever reared under a roof. I half believed her; for I felt indeed only bad feelings surg-ing in my breast.<p></p> <p></p> November, December, and half of January passed away. Christmas and the New Year had been celebrated at Gateshead with the usual festive cheer; presents had been interchanged, dinners and evening parties given. From ev-ery enjoyment I was, of course, excluded: my share of the gaiety consisted in witnessing the daily apparelling of Eliza and Georgiana, and seeing them descend to the drawing-room, dressed out in thin muslin frocks and scarlet sashes, with hair elaborately ringletted; and afterwards, in listening to the sound of the piano or the harp played below, to the passing to and fro of the butler and footman, to the jingling of glass and china as refreshments were handed, to the bro-ken hum of conversation as the drawing-room door opened and closed. When tired of this occupation, I would retire from the stairhead to the solitary and silent nursery: there, though somewhat sad, I was not miserable. To speak truth, I had not the least wish to go into company, for in company I<p></p>

was very rarely noticed; and if Bessie had but been kind and companionable, I should have deemed it a treat to spend the evenings quietly with her, instead of passing them under the formidable eye of Mrs. Reed, in a room full of ladies and gentlemen. But Bessie, as soon as she had dressed her young ladies, used to take herself off to the lively regions of the kitchen and housekeeper’s room, generally bearing the can-dle along with her. I then sat with my doll on my knee till the fire got low, glancing round occasionally to make sure that nothing worse than myself haunted the shadowy room; and when the embers sank to a dull red, I undressed hast-ily, tugging at knots and strings as I best might, and sought shelter from cold and darkness in my crib. To this crib I al-ways took my doll; human beings must love something, and, in the dearth of worthier objects of affection, I contrived to find a pleasure in loving and cherishing a faded graven im-age, shabby as a miniature scarecrow. It puzzles me now to remember with what absurd sincerity I doated on this little toy, half fancying it alive and capable of sensation. I could not sleep unless it was folded in my night-gown; and when it lay there safe and warm, I was comparatively happy, be-lieving it to be happy likewise.<p></p> <p></p> Long did the hours seem while I waited the departure of the company, and listened for the sound of Bessie’s step on the stairs: sometimes she would come up in the interval to seek her thimble or her scissors, or perhaps to bring me something by way of supper—a bun or a cheese-cake—then she would sit on the bed while I ate it, and when I had fin-ished, she would tuck the clothes round me, and twice she<p></p>  
<p></p> 40	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
kissed me, and said, ‘Good night, Miss Jane.’ When thus gentle, Bessie seemed to me the best, prettiest, kindest being in the world; and I wished most intensely that she would al-ways be so pleasant and amiable, and never push me about, or scold, or task me unreasonably, as she was too often wont to do. Bessie Lee must, I think, have been a girl of good natural capacity, for she was smart in all she did, and had a remarkable knack of narrative; so, at least, I judge from the impression made on me by her nursery tales. She was pretty too, if my recollections of her face and person are correct. I remember her as a slim young woman, with black hair, dark eyes, very nice features, and good, clear complexion; but she had a capricious and hasty temper, and indifferent ideas of principle or justice: still, such as she was, I preferred her to any one else at Gateshead Hall.<p></p> <p></p> It was the fifteenth of January, about nine o’clock in the morning: Bessie was gone down to breakfast; my cousins had not yet been summoned to their mama; Eliza was put-ting on her bonnet and warm garden-coat to go and feed her poultry, an occupation of which she was fond: and not less so of selling the eggs to the housekeeper and hoarding up the money she thus obtained. She had a turn for traffic, and a marked propensity for saving; shown not only in the vending of eggs and chickens, but also in driving hard bar-gains with the gardener about flower-roots, seeds, and slips of plants; that functionary having orders from Mrs. Reed to buy of his young lady all the products of her parterre she wished to sell: and Eliza would have sold the hair off her head if she could have made a handsome profit thereby. As<p></p>

to her money, she first secreted it in odd corners, wrapped in a rag or an old curl-paper; but some of these hoards hav-ing been discovered by the housemaid, Eliza, fearful of one day losing her valued treasure, consented to intrust it to her mother, at a usurious rate of interest—fifty or sixty per cent.; which interest she exacted every quarter, keeping her accounts in a little book with anxious accuracy.<p></p> <p></p> Georgiana sat on a high stool, dressing her hair at the glass, and interweaving her curls with artificial flowers and faded feathers, of which she had found a store in a drawer in the attic. I was making my bed, having received strict or-ders from Bessie to get it arranged before she returned (for Bessie now frequently employed me as a sort of under-nurs-erymaid, to tidy the room, dust the chairs, &c.). Having spread the quilt and folded my night-dress, I went to the window-seat to put in order some picture-books and doll’s house furniture scattered there; an abrupt command from Georgiana to let her playthings alone (for the tiny chairs and mirrors, the fairy plates and cups, were her property) stopped my proceedings; and then, for lack of other occupa-tion, I fell to breathing on the frost-flowers with which the window was fretted, and thus clearing a space in the glass through which I might look out on the grounds, where all was still and petrified under the influence of a hard frost.<p></p> <p></p> From this window were visible the porter’s lodge and the carriage- road, and just as I had dissolved so much of the silver-white foliage veiling the panes as left room to look out, I saw the gates thrown open and a carriage roll through. I watched it ascending the drive with indifference; carriages<p></p>  
<p></p> 42	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
often came to Gateshead, but none ever brought visitors in whom I was interested; it stopped in front of the house, the door-bell rang loudly, the new-comer was admitted. All this being nothing to me, my vacant attention soon found liveli-er attraction in the spectacle of a little hungry robin, which came and chirruped on the twigs of the leafless cherry-tree nailed against the wall near the casement. The remains of my breakfast of bread and milk stood on the table, and hav-ing crumbled a morsel of roll, I was tugging at the sash to put out the crumbs on the window- sill, when Bessie came running upstairs into the nursery.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Miss Jane, take off your pinafore; what are you doing there? Have you washed your hands and face this morn-ing?’ I gave another tug before I answered, for I wanted the bird to be secure of its bread: the sash yielded; I scattered the crumbs, some on the stone sill, some on the cherry-tree bough, then, closing the window, I replied—<p></p> <p></p> ‘No, Bessie; I have only just finished dusting.’ ‘Troublesome, careless child! and what are you doing<p></p> <p></p> now? You look quite red, as if you had been about some mis-chief: what were you opening the window for?’<p></p> <p></p> I was spared the trouble of answering, for Bessie seemed in too great a hurry to listen to explanations; she hauled me to the washstand, inflicted a merciless, but happily brief scrub on my face and hands with soap, water, and a coarse towel; disciplined my head with a bristly brush, denuded me of my pinafore, and then hurrying me to the top of the stairs, bid me go down directly, as I was wanted in the breakfast-room.<p></p>

I would have asked who wanted me: I would have de-manded if Mrs. Reed was there; but Bessie was already gone, and had closed the nursery-door upon me. I slowly descend-ed. For nearly three months, I had never been called to Mrs. Reed’s presence; restricted so long to the nursery, the break-fast, dining, and drawing-rooms were become for me awful regions, on which it dismayed me to intrude.<p></p> <p></p> I now stood in the empty hall; before me was the break-fast-room door, and I stopped, intimidated and trembling. What a miserable little poltroon had fear, engendered of un-just punishment, made of me in those days! I feared to return to the nursery, and feared to go forward to the parlour; ten minutes I stood in agitated hesitation; the vehement ringing of the breakfast-room bell decided me; I MUST enter.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Who could want me?’ I asked inwardly, as with both hands I turned the stiff door-handle, which, for a second or two, resisted my efforts. ‘What should I see besides Aunt Reed in the apartment?—a man or a woman?’ The handle turned, the door unclosed, and passing through and curt-seying low, I looked up at—a black pillar!—such, at least, appeared to me, at first sight, the straight, narrow, sable-clad shape standing erect on the rug: the grim face at the top was like a carved mask, placed above the shaft by way of capital.<p></p> <p></p> Mrs. Reed occupied her usual seat by the fireside; she made a signal to me to approach; I did so, and she intro-duced me to the stony stranger with the words: ‘This is the little girl respecting whom I applied to you.’<p></p> <p></p> HE, for it was a man, turned his head slowly towards<p></p>  
<p></p> 44	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
where I stood, and having examined me with the two in-quisitive-looking grey eyes which twinkled under a pair of bushy brows, said solemnly, and in a bass voice, ‘Her size is small: what is her age?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Ten years.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘So much?’ was the doubtful answer; and he prolonged his scrutiny for some minutes. Presently he addressed me— ‘Your name, little girl?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Jane Eyre, sir.’<p></p> <p></p> In uttering these words I looked up: he seemed to me a tall gentleman; but then I was very little; his features were large, and they and all the lines of his frame were equally harsh and prim.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Well, Jane Eyre, and are you a good child?’<p></p> <p></p> Impossible to reply to this in the affirmative: my little world held a contrary opinion: I was silent. Mrs. Reed an-swered for me by an expressive shake of the head, adding soon, ‘Perhaps the less said on that subject the better, Mr. Brocklehurst.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Sorry indeed to hear it! she and I must have some talk;’ and bending from the perpendicular, he installed his per-son in the arm- chair opposite Mrs. Reed’s. ‘Come here,’ he said.<p></p> <p></p> I stepped across the rug; he placed me square and straight before him. What a face he had, now that it was almost on a level with mine! what a great nose! and what a mouth! and what large prominent teeth!<p></p> <p></p> ‘No sight so sad as that of a naughty child,’ he began, ‘es-pecially a naughty little girl. Do you know where the wicked<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	45<p></p>  
go after death?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘They go to hell,’ was my ready and orthodox answer. ‘And what is hell? Can you tell me that?’ ‘A pit full of fire.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘And should you like to fall into that pit, and to be burn-ing there for ever?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘No, sir.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘What must you do to avoid it?’<p></p> <p></p> I deliberated a moment; my answer, when it did come, was objectionable: ‘I must keep in good health, and not die.’ ‘How can you keep in good health? Children younger than you die daily. I buried a little child of five years old only a day or two since,—a good little child, whose soul is now in heaven. It is to be feared the same could not be said<p></p> <p></p> of you were you to be called hence.’<p></p> <p></p> Not being in a condition to remove his doubt, I only cast my eyes down on the two large feet planted on the rug, and sighed, wishing myself far enough away.<p></p> <p></p> ‘I hope that sigh is from the heart, and that you repent of ever having been the occasion of discomfort to your excel-lent benefactress.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Benefactress! benefactress!’ said I inwardly: ‘they all call Mrs. Reed my benefactress; if so, a benefactress is a dis-agreeable thing.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Do you say your prayers night and morning?’ continued my interrogator.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Yes, sir.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Do you read your Bible?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Sometimes.’<p></p>  
<p></p> 46	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
‘With pleasure? Are you fond of it?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘I like Revelations, and the book of Daniel, and Genesis and Samuel, and a little bit of Exodus, and some parts of Kings and Chronicles, and Job and Jonah.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘And the Psalms? I hope you like them?’ ‘No, sir.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘No? oh, shocking! I have a little boy, younger than you, who knows six Psalms by heart: and when you ask him which he would rather have, a gingerbread-nut to eat or a verse of a Psalm to learn, he says: ‘Oh! the verse of a Psalm! angels sing Psalms;’ says he, ‘I wish to be a little angel here below;’ he then gets two nuts in recompense for his infant piety.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Psalms are not interesting,’ I remarked.<p></p> <p></p> ‘That proves you have a wicked heart; and you must pray to God to change it: to give you a new and clean one: to take away your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh.’<p></p> <p></p> I was about to propound a question, touching the man-ner in which that operation of changing my heart was to be performed, when Mrs. Reed interposed, telling me to sit down; she then proceeded to carry on the conversation her-self.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Mr. Brocklehurst, I believe I intimated in the letter which I wrote to you three weeks ago, that this little girl has not quite the character and disposition I could wish: should you admit her into Lowood school, I should be glad if the superintendent and teachers were requested to keep a strict eye on her, and, above all, to guard against her worst fault, a tendency to deceit. I mention this in your hearing, Jane,<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	47<p></p>  
that you may not attempt to impose on Mr. Brocklehurst.’ Well might I dread, well might I dislike Mrs. Reed; for it<p></p> <p></p> was her nature to wound me cruelly; never was I happy in her presence; however carefully I obeyed, however strenu-ously I strove to please her, my efforts were still repulsed and repaid by such sentences as the above. Now, uttered be-fore a stranger, the accusation cut me to the heart; I dimly perceived that she was already obliterating hope from the new phase of existence which she destined me to enter; I felt, though I could not have expressed the feeling, that she was sowing aversion and unkindness along my future path; I saw myself transformed under Mr. Brocklehurst’s eye into an artful, noxious child, and what could I do to remedy the injury?<p></p> <p></p> ‘Nothing, indeed,’ thought I, as I struggled to repress a sob, and hastily wiped away some tears, the impotent evi-dences of my anguish.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Deceit is, indeed, a sad fault in a child,’ said Mr. Brock-lehurst; ‘it is akin to falsehood, and all liars will have their portion in the lake burning with fire and brimstone; she shall, however, be watched, Mrs. Reed. I will speak to Miss Temple and the teachers.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘I should wish her to be brought up in a manner suiting her prospects,’ continued my benefactress; ‘to be made use-ful, to be kept humble: as for the vacations, she will, with your permission, spend them always at Lowood.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Your decisions are perfectly judicious, madam,’ returned Mr. Brocklehurst. ‘Humility is a Christian grace, and one peculiarly appropriate to the pupils of Lowood; I, therefore,<p></p>  
<p></p> 48	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
direct that especial care shall be bestowed on its cultiva-tion amongst them. I have studied how best to mortify in them the worldly sentiment of pride; and, only the other day, I had a pleasing proof of my success. My second daugh-ter, Augusta, went with her mama to visit the school, and on her return she exclaimed: ‘Oh, dear papa, how quiet and plain all the girls at Lowood look, with their hair combed behind their ears, and their long pinafores, and those little holland pockets outside their frocks—they are almost like poor people’s children! and,’ said she, ‘they looked at my dress and mama’s, as if they had never seen a silk gown be-fore.’’<p></p> <p></p> ‘This is the state of things I quite approve,’ returned Mrs. Reed; ‘had I sought all England over, I could scarcely have found a system more exactly fitting a child like Jane Eyre. Consistency, my dear Mr. Brocklehurst; I advocate consis-tency in all things.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Consistency, madam, is the first of Christian duties; and it has been observed in every arrangement connected with the establishment of Lowood: plain fare, simple attire, unso-phisticated accommodations, hardy and active habits; such is the order of the day in the house and its inhabitants.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Quite right, sir. I may then depend upon this child being received as a pupil at Lowood, and there being trained in conformity to her position and prospects?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Madam, you may: she shall be placed in that nursery of chosen plants, and I trust she will show herself grateful for the inestimable privilege of her election.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘I will send her, then, as soon as possible, Mr. Brockle-<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	49<p></p>  
hurst; for, I assure you, I feel anxious to be relieved of a responsibility that was becoming too irksome.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘No doubt, no doubt, madam; and now I wish you good morning. I shall return to Brocklehurst Hall in the course of a week or two: my good friend, the Archdeacon, will not permit me to leave him sooner. I shall send Miss Temple no-tice that she is to expect a new girl, so that there will he no difficulty about receiving her. Good-bye.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Good-bye, Mr. Brocklehurst; remember me to Mrs. and Miss Brocklehurst, and to Augusta and Theodore, and Mas-ter Broughton Brocklehurst.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘I will, madam. Little girl, here is a book entitled the ‘Child’s Guide,’ read it with prayer, especially that part con-taining ‘An account of the awfully sudden death of Martha G—, a naughty child addicted to falsehood and deceit.’’<p></p> <p></p> With these words Mr. Brocklehurst put into my hand a thin pamphlet sewn in a cover, and having rung for his car-riage, he departed.<p></p> <p></p> Mrs. Reed and I were left alone: some minutes passed in silence; she was sewing, I was watching her. Mrs. Reed might be at that time some six or seven and thirty; she was<p></p> <p></p> woman of robust frame, square-shouldered and strong-limbed, not tall, and, though stout, not obese: she had a somewhat large face, the under jaw being much developed and very solid; her brow was low, her chin large and promi-nent, mouth and nose sufficiently regular; under her light eyebrows glimmered an eye devoid of ruth; her skin was dark and opaque, her hair nearly flaxen; her constitution was sound as a bell—illness never came near her; she was<p></p>  
<p></p> 50	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
an exact, clever manager; her household and tenantry were thoroughly under her control; her children only at times defied her authority and laughed it to scorn; she dressed well, and had a presence and port calculated to set off hand-some attire.<p></p> <p></p> Sitting on a low stool, a few yards from her arm- chair, I examined her figure; I perused her features. In my hand I held the tract containing the sudden death of the Liar, to which narrative my attention had been pointed as to an ap-propriate warning. What had just passed; what Mrs. Reed had said concerning me to Mr. Brocklehurst; the whole ten-or of their conversation, was recent, raw, and stinging in my mind; I had felt every word as acutely as I had heard it plain-ly, and a passion of resentment fomented now within me.<p></p> <p></p> Mrs. Reed looked up from her work; her eye settled on mine, her fingers at the same time suspended their nimble movements.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Go out of the room; return to the nursery,’ was her man-date. My look or something else must have struck her as offensive, for she spoke with extreme though suppressed ir-ritation. I got up, I went to the door; I came back again; I walked to the window, across the room, then close up to her.<p></p> <p></p> SPEAK I must: I had been trodden on severely, and MUST turn: but how? What strength had I to dart retalia-tion at my antagonist? I gathered my energies and launched them in this blunt sentence—<p></p> <p></p> ‘I am not deceitful: if I were, I should say I loved you; but<p></p> <p></p> I declare I do not love you: I dislike you the worst of any-<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	51<p></p>  
body in the world except John Reed; and this book about the liar, you may give to your girl, Georgiana, for it is she who tells lies, and not I.’<p></p> <p></p> Mrs. Reed’s hands still lay on her work inactive: her eye of ice continued to dwell freezingly on mine.<p></p> <p></p> ‘What more have you to say?’ she asked, rather in the tone in which a person might address an opponent of adult age than such as is ordinarily used to a child.<p></p> <p></p> That eye of hers, that voice stirred every antipathy I had. Shaking from head to foot, thrilled with ungovernable excitement, I continued—<p></p> <p></p> ‘I am glad you are no relation of mine: I will never call you aunt again as long as I live. I will never come to see you when I am grown up; and if any one asks me how I liked you, and how you treated me, I will say the very thought of you makes me sick, and that you treated me with miserable cruelty.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘How dare you affirm that, Jane Eyre?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘How dare I, Mrs. Reed? How dare I? Because it is the TRUTH. You think I have no feelings, and that I can do without one bit of love or kindness; but I cannot live so: and you have no pity. I shall remember how you thrust me back—roughly and violently thrust me back—into the red-room, and locked me up there, to my dying day; though I was in agony; though I cried out, while suffocating with distress, ‘Have mercy! Have mercy, Aunt Reed!’ And that punishment you made me suffer because your wicked boy struck me—knocked me down for nothing. I will tell any-body who asks me questions, this exact tale. People think<p></p>  
<p></p> 52	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
you a good woman, but you are bad, hard- hearted. YOU are deceitful!’<p></p> <p></p> Ere I had finished this reply, my soul began to expand, to exult, with the strangest sense of freedom, of triumph, I ever felt. It seemed as if an invisible bond had burst, and that I had struggled out into unhoped-for liberty. Not with-out cause was this sentiment: Mrs. Reed looked frightened; her work had slipped from her knee; she was lifting up her hands, rocking herself to and fro, and even twisting her face as if she would cry.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Jane, you are under a mistake: what is the matter with<p></p> <p></p> you? Why do you tremble so violently? Would you like to<p></p> <p></p> drink some water?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘No, Mrs. Reed.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Is there anything else you wish for, Jane? I assure you, I desire to be your friend.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Not you. You told Mr. Brocklehurst I had a bad charac-ter, a deceitful disposition; and I’ll let everybody at Lowood know what you are, and what you have done.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Jane, you don’t understand these things: children must be corrected for their faults.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Deceit is not my fault!’ I cried out in a savage, high voice.<p></p> <p></p> ‘But you are passionate, Jane, that you must allow: and now return to the nursery—there’s a dear—and lie down a little.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘I am not your dear; I cannot lie down: send me to school soon, Mrs. Reed, for I hate to live here.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘I will indeed send her to school soon,’ murmured Mrs.<p></p>

Reed sotto voce; and gathering up her work, she abruptly quitted the apartment.<p></p> <p></p> I was left there alone—winner of the field. It was the hardest battle I had fought, and the first victory I had gained: I stood awhile on the rug, where Mr. Brocklehu-rst had stood, and I enjoyed my conqueror’s solitude. First, I smiled to myself and felt elate; but this fierce pleasure subsided in me as fast as did the accelerated throb of my pulses. A child cannot quarrel with its elders, as I had done; cannot give its furious feelings uncontrolled play, as I had given mine, without experiencing afterwards the pang of remorse and the chill of reaction. A ridge of lighted heath, alive, glancing, devouring, would have been a meet em-blem of my mind when I accused and menaced Mrs. Reed: the same ridge, black and blasted after the flames are dead, would have represented as meetly my subsequent condition, when half-an-hour’s silence and reflection had shown me the madness of my conduct, and the dreariness of my hated and hating position.<p></p> <p></p> Something of vengeance I had tasted for the first time; as aromatic wine it seemed, on swallowing, warm and racy: its after-flavour, metallic and corroding, gave me a sensation as if I had been poisoned. Willingly would I now have gone and asked Mrs. Reed’s pardon; but I knew, partly from ex-perience and partly from instinct, that was the way to make her repulse me with double scorn, thereby re-exciting every turbulent impulse of my nature.<p></p> <p></p> I would fain exercise some better faculty than that of fierce speaking; fain find nourishment for some less fiendish<p></p>  
<p></p> 54	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
feeling than that of sombre indignation. I took a book— some Arabian tales; I sat down and endeavoured to read. I could make no sense of the subject; my own thoughts swam always between me and the page I had usually found fasci-nating. I opened the glass-door in the breakfast-room: the shrubbery was quite still: the black frost reigned, unbroken by sun or breeze, through the grounds. I covered my head and arms with the skirt of my frock, and went out to walk in a part of the plantation which was quite sequestrated; but I found no pleasure in the silent trees, the falling fir-cones, the congealed relics of autumn, russet leaves, swept by past winds in heaps, and now stiffened together. I leaned against a gate, and looked into an empty field where no sheep were feeding, where the short grass was nipped and blanched. It was a very grey day; a most opaque sky, ‘onding on snaw,’ canopied all; thence flakes felt it intervals, which settled on the hard path and on the hoary lea without melting. I stood, a wretched child enough, whispering to myself over and over again, ‘What shall I do?—what shall I do?’<p></p> <p></p> All at once I heard a clear voice call, ‘Miss Jane! where are you? Come to lunch!’<p></p> <p></p> It was Bessie, I knew well enough; but I did not stir; her light step came tripping down the path.<p></p> <p></p> ‘You naughty little thing!’ she said. ‘Why don’t you come when you are called?’<p></p> <p></p> Bessie’s presence, compared with the thoughts over which I had been brooding, seemed cheerful; even though, as usual, she was somewhat cross. The fact is, after my con-flict with and victory over Mrs. Reed, I was not disposed to<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	55<p></p>  
care much for the nursemaid’s transitory anger; and I WAS disposed to bask in her youthful lightness of heart. I just put my two arms round her and said, ‘Come, Bessie! don’t scold.’<p></p> <p></p> The action was more frank and fearless than any I was habituated to indulge in: somehow it pleased her.<p></p> <p></p> ‘You are a strange child, Miss Jane,’ she said, as she looked down at me; ‘a little roving, solitary thing: and you are go-ing to school, I suppose?’<p></p> <p></p> I nodded.<p></p> <p></p> ‘And won’t you be sorry to leave poor Bessie?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘What does Bessie care for me? She is always scolding me.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Because you’re such a queer, frightened, shy little thing. You should be bolder.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘What! to get more knocks?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Nonsense! But you are rather put upon, that’s certain. My mother said, when she came to see me last week, that she would not like a little one of her own to be in your place.— Now, come in, and I’ve some good news for you.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘I don’t think you have, Bessie.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Child! what do you mean? What sorrowful eyes you fix on me! Well, but Missis and the young ladies and Master John are going out to tea this afternoon, and you shall have tea with me. I’ll ask cook to bake you a little cake, and then you shall help me to look over your drawers; for I am soon to pack your trunk. Missis intends you to leave Gateshead in a day or two, and you shall choose what toys you like to take with you.’<p></p>  
<p></p> 56	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
‘Bessie, you must promise not to scold me any more till I go.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Well, I will; but mind you are a very good girl, and don’t be afraid of me. Don’t start when I chance to speak rather sharply; it’s so provoking.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘I don’t think I shall ever be afraid of you again, Bessie, because I have got used to you, and I shall soon have an-other set of people to dread.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘If you dread them they’ll dislike you.’ ‘As you do, Bessie?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘I don’t dislike you, Miss; I believe I am fonder of you than of all the others.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘You don’t show it.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘You little sharp thing! you’ve got quite a new way of talk-ing. What makes you so venturesome and hardy?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Why, I shall soon be away from you, and besides’—I was going to say something about what had passed between me and Mrs. Reed, but on second thoughts I considered it bet-ter to remain silent on that head.<p></p> <p></p> ‘And so you’re glad to leave me?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Not at all, Bessie; indeed, just now I’m rather sorry.’ ‘Just now! and rather! How coolly my little lady says it! I<p></p> <p></p> dare say now if I were to ask you for a kiss you wouldn’t give it me: you’d say you’d RATHER not.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘I’ll kiss you and welcome: bend your head down.’ Bes-sie stooped; we mutually embraced, and I followed her into the house quite comforted. That afternoon lapsed in peace and harmony; and in the evening Bessie told me some of her most enchaining stories, and sang me some of her sweetest<p></p>

Chapter V<p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> Five o’clock had hardly struck on the morning of the 19th of January, when Bessie brought a candle into my closet and found me already up and nearly dressed. I had risen half-an-hour before her entrance, and had washed my face, and put on my clothes by the light of a half-moon just set-ting, whose rays streamed through the narrow window near my crib. I was to leave Gateshead that day by a coach which passed the lodge gates at six a.m. Bessie was the only per-son yet risen; she had lit a fire in the nursery, where she now proceeded to make my breakfast. Few children can eat when excited with the thoughts of a journey; nor could I. Bessie, having pressed me in vain to take a few spoon-fuls of the boiled milk and bread she had prepared for me, wrapped up some biscuits in a paper and put them into my bag; then she helped me on with my pelisse and bonnet, and wrapping herself in a shawl, she and I left the nursery. As we passed Mrs. Reed’s bedroom, she said, ‘Will you go in and<p></p> <p></p> bid Missis good-bye?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘No, Bessie: she came to my crib last night when you were gone down to supper, and said I need not disturb her in the morning, or my cousins either; and she told me to remem-ber that she had always been my best friend, and to speak of her and be grateful to her accordingly.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘What did you say, Miss?’<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	59<p></p>  
‘Nothing: I covered my face with the bedclothes, and turned from her to the wall.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘That was wrong, Miss Jane.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘It was quite right, Bessie. Your Missis has not been my friend: she has been my foe.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘O Miss Jane! don’t say so!’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Good-bye to Gateshead!’ cried I, as we passed through the hall and went out at the front door.<p></p> <p></p> The moon was set, and it was very dark; Bessie carried a lantern, whose light glanced on wet steps and gravel road sodden by a recent thaw. Raw and chill was the winter morning: my teeth chattered as I hastened down the drive. There was a light in the porter’s lodge: when we reached it, we found the porter’s wife just kindling her fire: my trunk, which had been carried down the evening before, stood corded at the door. It wanted but a few minutes of six, and shortly after that hour had struck, the distant roll of wheels announced the coming coach; I went to the door and watched its lamps approach rapidly through the gloom.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Is she going by herself?’ asked the porter’s wife.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Yes.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘And how far is it?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Fifty miles.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘What a long way! I wonder Mrs. Reed is not afraid to trust her so far alone.’<p></p> <p></p> The coach drew up; there it was at the gates with its four horses and its top laden with passengers: the guard and coachman loudly urged haste; my trunk was hoisted up; I was taken from Bessie’s neck, to which I clung with kisses.<p></p>  
<p></p> 60	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
‘Be sure and take good care of her,’ cried she to the guard, as he lifted me into the inside.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Ay, ay!’ was the answer: the door was slapped to, a voice exclaimed ‘All right,’ and on we drove. Thus was I severed from Bessie and Gateshead; thus whirled away to unknown, and, as I then deemed, remote and mysterious regions.<p></p> <p></p> I remember but little of the journey; I only know that the day seemed to me of a preternatural length, and that we appeared to travel over hundreds of miles of road. We passed through several towns, and in one, a very large one, the coach stopped; the horses were taken out, and the pas-sengers alighted to dine. I was carried into an inn, where the guard wanted me to have some dinner; but, as I had no appetite, he left me in an immense room with a fireplace at each end, a chandelier pendent from the ceiling, and a little red gallery high up against the wall filled with musical instruments. Here I walked about for a long time, feeling very strange, and mortally apprehensive of some one com-ing in and kidnapping me; for I believed in kidnappers, their exploits having frequently figured in Bessie’s fireside chronicles. At last the guard returned; once more I was stowed away in the coach, my protector mounted his own seat, sounded his hollow horn, and away we rattled over the ‘stony street’ of L-.<p></p> <p></p> The afternoon came on wet and somewhat misty: as it waned into dusk, I began to feel that we were getting very far indeed from Gateshead: we ceased to pass through towns; the country changed; great grey hills heaved up round the horizon: as twilight deepened, we descended a valley, dark<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	61<p></p>  
with wood, and long after night had overclouded the pros-pect, I heard a wild wind rushing amongst trees.<p></p> <p></p> Lulled by the sound, I at last dropped asleep; I had not long slumbered when the sudden cessation of motion awoke me; the coach- door was open, and a person like a servant was standing at it: I saw her face and dress by the light of the lamps.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Is there a little girl called Jane Eyre here?’ she asked. I answered ‘Yes,’ and was then lifted out; my trunk was hand-ed down, and the coach instantly drove away.<p></p> <p></p> I was stiff with long sitting, and bewildered with the noise and motion of the coach: Gathering my faculties, I looked about me. Rain, wind, and darkness filled the air; nevertheless, I dimly discerned a wall before me and a door open in it; through this door I passed with my new guide: she shut and locked it behind her. There was now visible a house or houses—for the building spread far—with many windows, and lights burning in some; we went up a broad pebbly path, splashing wet, and were admitted at a door; then the servant led me through a passage into a room with a fire, where she left me alone.<p></p> <p></p> I stood and warmed my numbed fingers over the blaze, then I looked round; there was no candle, but the uncer-tain light from the hearth showed, by intervals, papered walls, carpet, curtains, shining mahogany furniture: it was a parlour, not so spacious or splendid as the drawing-room at Gateshead, but comfortable enough. I was puzzling to make out the subject of a picture on the wall, when the door opened, and an individual carrying a light entered; another<p></p>  
<p></p> 62	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
followed close behind.<p></p> <p></p> The first was a tall lady with dark hair, dark eyes, and a pale and large forehead; her figure was partly enveloped in a shawl, her countenance was grave, her bearing erect.<p></p> <p></p> ‘The child is very young to be sent alone,’ said she, putting her candle down on the table. She considered me attentively for a minute or two, then further added—<p></p> <p></p> ‘She had better be put to bed soon; she looks tired: are you tired?’ she asked, placing her hand on my shoulder.<p></p> <p></p> ‘A little, ma’am.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘And hungry too, no doubt: let her have some supper be-fore she goes to bed, Miss Miller. Is this the first time you have left your parents to come to school, my little girl?’<p></p> <p></p> I explained to her that I had no parents. She inquired how long they had been dead: then how old I was, what was my name, whether I could read, write, and sew a little: then she touched my cheek gently with her forefinger, and saying, ‘She hoped I should be a good child,’ dismissed me along with Miss Miller.<p></p> <p></p> The lady I had left might be about twenty-nine; the one who went with me appeared some years younger: the first impressed me by her voice, look, and air. Miss Miller was more ordinary; ruddy in complexion, though of a careworn countenance; hurried in gait and action, like one who had always a multiplicity of tasks on hand: she looked, indeed, what I afterwards found she really was, an under-teacher. Led by her, I passed from compartment to compartment, from passage to passage, of a large and irregular building; till, emerging from the total and somewhat dreary silence<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	63<p></p>  
pervading that portion of the house we had traversed, we came upon the hum of many voices, and presently entered a wide, long room, with great deal tables, two at each end, on each of which burnt a pair of candles, and seated all round on benches, a congregation of girls of every age, from nine or ten to twenty. Seen by the dim light of the dips, their number to me appeared countless, though not in reality ex-ceeding eighty; they were uniformly dressed in brown stuff frocks of quaint fashion, and long holland pinafores. It was the hour of study; they were engaged in conning over their to- morrow’s task, and the hum I had heard was the com-bined result of their whispered repetitions.<p></p> <p></p> Miss Miller signed to me to sit on a bench near the door, then walking up to the top of the long room she cried out— ‘Monitors, collect the lesson-books and put them away!<p></p> <p></p> Four tall girls arose from different tables, and going round, gathered the books and removed them. Miss Miller again gave the word of command—<p></p> <p></p> ‘Monitors, fetch the supper-trays!’<p></p> <p></p> The tall girls went out and returned presently, each bear-ing a tray, with portions of something, I knew not what, arranged thereon, and a pitcher of water and mug in the middle of each tray. The portions were handed round; those who liked took a draught of the water, the mug being com-mon to all. When it came to my turn, I drank, for I was thirsty, but did not touch the food, excitement and fatigue rendering me incapable of eating: I now saw, however, that it was a thin oaten cake shared into fragments.<p></p> <p></p> The	meal over, prayers were read by Miss Miller, and the<p></p>  
<p></p> 64	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
classes filed off, two and two, upstairs. Overpowered by this time with weariness, I scarcely noticed what sort of a place the bedroom was, except that, like the schoolroom, I saw it was very long. To -night I was to be Miss Miller’s bed-fellow; she helped me to undress: when laid down I glanced at the long rows of beds, each of which was quickly filled with two occupants; in ten minutes the single light was extinguished, and amidst silence and complete darkness I fell asleep.<p></p> <p></p> The night passed rapidly. I was too tired even to dream; I only once awoke to hear the wind rave in furious gusts, and the rain fall in torrents, and to be sensible that Miss Miller had taken her place by my side. When I again unclosed my eyes, a loud bell was ringing; the girls were up and dress-ing; day had not yet begun to dawn, and a rushlight or two burned in the room. I too rose reluctantly; it was bitter cold, and I dressed as well as I could for shivering, and washed when there was a basin at liberty, which did not occur soon, as there was but one basin to six girls, on the stands down the middle of the room. Again the bell rang: all formed in file, two and two, and in that order descended the stairs and entered the cold and dimly lit schoolroom: here prayers were read by Miss Miller; afterwards she called out—<p></p> <p></p> ‘Form classes!’<p></p> <p></p> A great tumult succeeded for some minutes, during which Miss Miller repeatedly exclaimed, ‘Silence!’ and ‘Or-der!’ When it subsided, I saw them all drawn up in four semicircles, before four chairs, placed at the four tables; all held books in their hands, and a great book, like a Bible, lay on each table, before the vacant seat. A pause of some<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	65<p></p>  
seconds succeeded, filled up by the low, vague hum of num-bers; Miss Miller walked from class to class, hushing this indefinite sound.<p></p> <p></p> A distant bell tinkled: immediately three ladies entered the room, each walked to a table and took her seat. Miss Miller assumed the fourth vacant chair, which was that nearest the door, and around which the smallest of the chil-dren were assembled: to this inferior class I was called, and placed at the bottom of it.<p></p> <p></p> Business now began, the day’s Collect was repeated, then certain texts of Scripture were said, and to these succeeded a protracted reading of Chapters in the Bible, which lasted an hour. By the time that exercise was terminated, day had fully dawned. The indefatigable bell now sounded for the fourth time: the classes were marshalled and marched into another room to breakfast: how glad I was to behold a pros-pect of getting something to eat! I was now nearly sick from inanition, having taken so little the day before.<p></p> <p></p> The refectory was a great, low-ceiled, gloomy room; on two long tables smoked basins of something hot, which, however, to my dismay, sent forth an odour far from invit-ing. I saw a universal manifestation of discontent when the fumes of the repast met the nostrils of those destined to swallow it; from the van of the procession, the tall girls of the first class, rose the whispered words—<p></p> <p></p> ‘Disgusting! The porridge is burnt again!’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Silence!’ ejaculated a voice; not that of Miss Miller, but one of the upper teachers, a little and dark personage, smart-ly dressed, but of somewhat morose aspect, who installed<p></p>  
<p></p> 66	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
herself at the top of one table, while a more buxom lady pre-sided at the other. I looked in vain for her I had first seen the night before; she was not visible: Miss Miller occupied the foot of the table where I sat, and a strange, foreign-looking, elderly lady, the French teacher, as I afterwards found, took the corresponding seat at the other board. A long grace was said and a hymn sung; then a servant brought in some tea for the teachers, and the meal began.<p></p> <p></p> Ravenous, and now very faint, I devoured a spoonful or two of my portion without thinking of its taste; but the first edge of hunger blunted, I perceived I had got in hand a nauseous mess; burnt porridge is almost as bad as rotten potatoes; famine itself soon sickens over it. The spoons were moved slowly: I saw each girl taste her food and try to swal-low it; but in most cases the effort was soon relinquished. Breakfast was over, and none had breakfasted. Thanks be-ing returned for what we had not got, and a second hymn chanted, the refectory was evacuated for the schoolroom. I was one of the last to go out, and in passing the tables, I saw one teacher take a basin of the porridge and taste it; she looked at the others; all their countenances expressed displeasure, and one of them, the stout one, whispered—<p></p> <p></p> ‘Abominable stuff! How shameful!’<p></p> <p></p> A quarter of an hour passed before lessons again began, during which the schoolroom was in a glorious tumult; for that space of time it seemed to be permitted to talk loud and more freely, and they used their privilege. The whole con-versation ran on the breakfast, which one and all abused roundly. Poor things! it was the sole consolation they had.<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	67<p></p>  
Miss Miller was now the only teacher in the room: a group of great girls standing about her spoke with serious and sullen gestures. I heard the name of Mr. Brocklehurst pro-nounced by some lips; at which Miss Miller shook her head disapprovingly; but she made no great effort to cheek the general wrath; doubtless she shared in it.<p></p> <p></p> A clock in the schoolroom struck nine; Miss Miller left her circle, and standing in the middle of the room, cried—<p></p> <p></p> ‘Silence! To your seats!’<p></p> <p></p> Discipline prevailed: in five minutes the confused throng was resolved into order, and comparative silence quelled the Babel clamour of tongues. The upper teachers now punctually resumed their posts: but still, all seemed to wait. Ranged on benches down the sides of the room, the eighty girls sat motionless and erect; a quaint assemblage they ap-peared, all with plain locks combed from their faces, not a curl visible; in brown dresses, made high and surrounded by a narrow tucker about the throat, with little pockets of holland (shaped something like a Highlander’s purse) tied in front of their frocks, and destined to serve the purpose of a work- bag: all, too, wearing woollen stockings and coun-try-made shoes, fastened with brass buckles. Above twenty of those clad in this costume were full-grown girls, or rath-er young women; it suited them ill, and gave an air of oddity even to the prettiest.<p></p> <p></p> I was still looking at them, and also at intervals ex-amining the teachers—none of whom precisely pleased me; for the stout one was a little coarse, the dark one not a little fierce, the foreigner harsh and grotesque, and Miss<p></p>  
<p></p> 68	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
Miller, poor thing! looked purple, weather- beaten, and over-worked—when, as my eye wandered from face to face, the whole school rose simultaneously, as if moved by a com-mon spring.<p></p> <p></p> What was the matter? I had heard no order given: I was puzzled. Ere I had gathered my wits, the classes were again seated: but as all eyes were now turned to one point, mine followed the general direction, and encountered the person-age who had received me last night. She stood at the bottom of the long room, on the hearth; for there was a fire at each end; she surveyed the two rows of girls silently and gravely. Miss Miller approaching, seemed to ask her a question, and having received her answer, went back to her place, and said aloud—<p></p> <p></p> ‘Monitor of the first class, fetch the globes!’<p></p> <p></p> While the direction was being executed, the lady con-sulted moved slowly up the room. I suppose I have a considerable organ of veneration, for I retain yet the sense of admiring awe with which my eyes traced her steps. Seen now, in broad daylight, she looked tall, fair, and shapely; brown eyes with a benignant light in their irids, and a fine pencilling of long lashes round, relieved the whiteness of her large front; on each of her temples her hair, of a very dark brown, was clustered in round curls, according to the fashion of those times, when neither smooth bands nor long ringlets were in vogue; her dress, also in the mode of the day, was of purple cloth, relieved by a sort of Spanish trimming of black velvet; a gold watch (watches were not so common then as now) shone at her girdle. Let the reader<p></p>

add, to complete the picture, refined features; a complex-ion, if pale, clear; and a stately air and carriage, and he will have, at least, as clearly as words can give it, a correct idea of the exterior of Miss Temple—Maria Temple, as I afterwards saw the name written in a prayer-book intrusted to me to carry to church.<p></p> <p></p> The superintendent of Lowood (for such was this lady) having taken her seat before a pair of globes placed on one of the tables, summoned the first class round her, and com-menced giving a lesson on geography; the lower classes were called by the teachers: repetitions in history, grammar, &c., went on for an hour; writing and arithmetic succeeded, and music lessons were given by Miss Temple to some of the elder girls. The duration of each lesson was measured by the clock, which at last struck twelve. The superintendent rose—<p></p> <p></p> ‘I have a word to address to the pupils,’ said she.<p></p> <p></p> The tumult of cessation from lessons was already breaking forth, but it sank at her voice. She went on—<p></p> <p></p> ‘You had this morning a breakfast which you could not eat; you must be hungry:—I have ordered that a lunch of bread and cheese shall be served to all.’<p></p> <p></p> The teachers looked at her with a sort of surprise.<p></p> <p></p> ‘It is to be done on my responsibility,’ she added, in an explanatory tone to them, and immediately afterwards left the room.<p></p> <p></p> The bread and cheese was presently brought in and dis-tributed, to the high delight and refreshment of the whole school. The order was now given ‘To the garden!’ Each put<p></p>  
<p></p> 70	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
on a coarse straw bonnet, with strings of coloured calico, and a cloak of grey frieze. I was similarly equipped, and, following the stream, I made my way into the open air.<p></p> <p></p> The garden was a wide inclosure, surrounded with walls so high as to exclude every glimpse of prospect; a covered verandah ran down one side, and broad walks bordered a middle space divided into scores of little beds: these beds were assigned as gardens for the pupils to cultivate, and each bed had an owner. When full of flowers they would doubtless look pretty; but now, at the latter end of Janu-ary, all was wintry blight and brown decay. I shuddered as I stood and looked round me: it was an inclement day for outdoor exercise; not positively rainy, but darkened by a drizzling yellow fog; all under foot was still soaking wet with the floods of yesterday. The stronger among the girls ran about and engaged in active games, but sundry pale and thin ones herded together for shelter and warmth in the ve-randah; and amongst these, as the dense mist penetrated to their shivering frames, I heard frequently the sound of a hollow cough.<p></p> <p></p> As yet I had spoken to no one, nor did anybody seem to take notice of me; I stood lonely enough: but to that feeling of isolation I was accustomed; it did not oppress me much. I leant against a pillar of the verandah, drew my grey mantle close about me, and, trying to forget the cold which nipped me without, and the unsatisfied hunger which gnawed me within, delivered myself up to the employment of watch-ing and thinking. My reflections were too undefined and fragmentary to merit record: I hardly yet knew where I was;<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	71<p></p>  
Gateshead and my past life seemed floated away to an im-measurable distance; the present was vague and strange, and of the future I could form no conjecture. I looked round the convent-like garden, and then up at the house—a large building, half of which seemed grey and old, the other half quite new. The new part, containing the schoolroom and dormitory, was lit by mullioned and latticed windows, which gave it a church-like aspect; a stone tablet over the door bore this inscription:-<p></p> <p></p> ‘Lowood Institution.—This portion was rebuilt A.D.—, by Naomi Brocklehurst, of Brocklehurst Hall, in this coun-ty.’ ‘Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heav-en.’— St. Matt. v. 16.<p></p> <p></p> I read these words over and over again: I felt that an explanation belonged to them, and was unable fully to pen-etrate their import. I was still pondering the signification of ‘Institution,’ and endeavouring to make out a connection between the first words and the verse of Scripture, when the sound of a cough close behind me made me turn my head. I saw a girl sitting on a stone bench near; she was bent over a book, on the perusal of which she seemed intent: from where I stood I could see the title—it was ‘Rasselas;’ a name that struck me as strange, and consequently attractive. In turning a leaf she happened to look up, and I said to her directly—<p></p> <p></p> ‘Is your book interesting?’ I had already formed the in-tention of asking her to lend it to me some day.<p></p> <p></p> ‘I like it,’ she answered, after a pause of a second or two,<p></p>  
<p></p> 72	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
during which she examined me.<p></p> <p></p> ‘What is it about?’ I continued. I hardly know where I found the hardihood thus to open a conversation with a stranger; the step was contrary to my nature and habits: but I think her occupation touched a chord of sympathy some-where; for I too liked reading, though of a frivolous and childish kind; I could not digest or comprehend the serious or substantial.<p></p> <p></p> ‘You may look at it,’ replied the girl, offering me the book.<p></p> <p></p> I did so; a brief examination convinced me that the contents were less taking than the title: ‘Rasselas’ looked dull to my trifling taste; I saw nothing about fairies, noth-ing about genii; no bright variety seemed spread over the closely-printed pages. I returned it to her; she received it quietly, and without saying anything she was about to re-lapse into her former studious mood: again I ventured to disturb her—<p></p> <p></p> ‘Can you tell me what the writing on that stone over the door means? What is Lowood Institution?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘This house where you are come to live.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘And why do they call it Institution? Is it in any way dif-ferent from other schools?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘It is partly a charity-school: you and I, and all the rest of us, are charity- children. I suppose you are an orphan: are not either your father or your mother dead?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Both died before I can remember.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Well, all the girls here have lost either one or both parents, and this is called an institution for educating orphans.’<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	73<p></p>  
‘Do we pay no money? Do they keep us for nothing?’ ‘We pay, or our friends pay, fifteen pounds a year for<p></p> <p></p> each.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Then why do they call us charity-children?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Because fifteen pounds is not enough for board and teaching, and the deficiency is supplied by subscription.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Who subscribes?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Different benevolent-minded ladies and gentlemen in this neighbourhood and in London.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Who was Naomi Brocklehurst?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘The lady who built the new part of this house as that tablet records, and whose son overlooks and directs every-thing here.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Why?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Because he is treasurer and manager of the establish-ment.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Then this house does not belong to that tall lady who wears a watch, and who said we were to have some bread and cheese?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘To Miss Temple? Oh, no! I wish it did: she has to answer to Mr. Brocklehurst for all she does. Mr. Brocklehurst buys all our food and all our clothes.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Does he live here?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘No—two miles off, at a large hall.’ ‘Is he a good man?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘He is a clergyman, and is said to do a great deal of good.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Did you say that tall lady was called Miss Temple?’ ‘Yes.’<p></p>

‘And what are the other teachers called?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘The one with red cheeks is called Miss Smith; she at-tends to the work, and cuts out—for we make our own clothes, our frocks, and pelisses, and everything; the little one with black hair is Miss Scatcherd; she teaches history and grammar, and hears the second class repetitions; and the one who wears a shawl, and has a pocket- handkerchief tied to her side with a yellow ribband, is Madame Pierrot: she comes from Lisle, in France, and teaches French.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Do you like the teachers?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Well enough.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Do you like the little black one, and the Madame—?—I cannot pronounce her name as you do.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Miss Scatcherd is hasty—you must take care not to of-fend her; Madame Pierrot is not a bad sort of person.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘But Miss Temple is the best—isn’t she?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Miss Temple is very good and very clever; she is above the rest, because she knows far more than they do.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Have you been long here?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Two years.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Are you an orphan?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘My mother is dead.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Are you happy here?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘You ask rather too many questions. I have given you an-swers enough for the present: now I want to read.’<p></p> <p></p> But at that moment the summons sounded for dinner; all re-entered the house. The odour which now filled the refectory was scarcely more appetising than that which had regaled our nostrils at breakfast: the dinner was served in<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	75<p></p>  
two huge tin-plated vessels, whence rose a strong steam redolent of rancid fat. I found the mess to consist of indif-ferent potatoes and strange shreds of rusty meat, mixed and cooked together. Of this preparation a tolerably abundant plateful was apportioned to each pupil. I ate what I could, and wondered within myself whether every day’s fare would be like this.<p></p> <p></p> After dinner, we immediately adjourned to the school-room: lessons recommenced, and were continued till five o’clock.<p></p> <p></p> The only marked event of the afternoon was, that I saw the girl with whom I had conversed in the verandah dis-missed in disgrace by Miss Scatcherd from a history class, and sent to stand in the middle of the large schoolroom. The punishment seemed to me in a high degree ignomini-ous, especially for so great a girl—she looked thirteen or upwards. I expected she would show signs of great distress and shame; but to my surprise she neither wept nor blushed: composed, though grave, she stood, the central mark of all eyes. ‘How can she bear it so quietly—so firmly?’ I asked of myself. ‘Were I in her place, it seems to me I should wish the earth to open and swallow me up. She looks as if she were thinking of something beyond her punishment—beyond her situation: of something not round her nor before her. I have heard of day-dreams—is she in a day-dream now? Her eyes are fixed on the floor, but I am sure they do not see it— her sight seems turned in, gone down into her heart: she is looking at what she can remember, I believe; not at what is really present. I wonder what sort of a girl she is—whether<p></p>  
<p></p> 76	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
good or naughty.’<p></p> <p></p> Soon after five p.m. we had another meal, consisting of a small mug of coffee, and half-a-slice of brown bread. I devoured my bread and drank my coffee with relish; but I should have been glad of as much more—I was still hungry. Half- an-hour’s recreation succeeded, then study; then the glass of water and the piece of oat-cake, prayers, and bed. Such was my first day at Lowood.<p></p>  
<p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	77<p></p>  
Chapter VI<p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> The next day commenced as before, getting up and dress-ing by rushlight; but this morning we were obliged to dispense with the ceremony of washing; the water in the pitchers was frozen. A change had taken place in the weath-er the preceding evening, and a keen north-east wind, whistling through the crevices of our bedroom windows all night long, had made us shiver in our beds, and turned the<p></p> <p></p> contents of the ewers to ice.<p></p> <p></p> Before the long hour and a half of prayers and Bible-read-ing was over, I felt ready to perish with cold. Breakfast-time came at last, and this morning the porridge was not burnt; the quality was eatable, the quantity small. How small my portion seemed! I wished it had been doubled.<p></p> <p></p> In the course of the day I was enrolled a member of the fourth class, and regular tasks and occupations were assigned me: hitherto, I had only been a spectator of the proceedings at Lowood; I was now to become an actor therein. At first, being little accustomed to learn by heart, the lessons appeared to me both long and difficult; the fre-quent change from task to task, too, bewildered me; and I was glad when, about three o’clock in the afternoon, Miss Smith put into my hands a border of muslin two yards long, together with needle, thimble, &c., and sent me to sit in a quiet corner of the schoolroom, with directions to hem the<p></p>  
<p></p> 78	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
same. At that hour most of the others were sewing likewise; but one class still stood round Miss Scatcherd’s chair read-ing, and as all was quiet, the subject of their lessons could be heard, together with the manner in which each girl ac-quitted herself, and the animadversions or commendations of Miss Scatcherd on the performance. It was English his-tory: among the readers I observed my acquaintance of the verandah: at the commencement of the lesson, her place had been at the top of the class, but for some error of pro-nunciation, or some inattention to stops, she was suddenly sent to the very bottom. Even in that obscure position, Miss Scatcherd continued to make her an object of constant no-tice: she was continually addressing to her such phrases as the following:-<p></p> <p></p> ‘Burns’ (such it seems was her name: the girls here were all called by their surnames, as boys are elsewhere), ‘Burns, you are standing on the side of your shoe; turn your toes out immediately.’ ‘Burns, you poke your chin most unpleasant-ly; draw it in.’ ‘Burns, I insist on your holding your head up; I will not have you before me in that attitude,’ &c. &c.<p></p> <p></p> A Chapter having been read through twice, the books were closed and the girls examined. The lesson had com-prised part of the reign of Charles I., and there were sundry questions about tonnage and poundage and ship-money, which most of them appeared unable to answer; still, every little difficulty was solved instantly when it reached Burns: her memory seemed to have retained the substance of the whole lesson, and she was ready with answers on every point. I kept expecting that Miss Scatcherd would praise<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	79<p></p>  
her attention; but, instead of that, she suddenly cried out— ‘You dirty, disagreeable girl! you have never cleaned your<p></p> <p></p> nails this morning!’<p></p> <p></p> Burns made no answer: I wondered at her silence. ‘Why,’ thought I, ‘does she not explain that she could neither clean her nails nor wash her face, as the water was frozen?’<p></p> <p></p> My attention was now called off by Miss Smith desiring me to hold a skein of thread: while she was winding it, she talked to me from time to time, asking whether I had ever been at school before, whether I could mark, stitch, knit, &c.; till she dismissed me, I could not pursue my observa-tions on Miss Scatcherd’s movements. When I returned to my seat, that lady was just delivering an order of which I did not catch the import; but Burns immediately left the class, and going into the small inner room where the books were kept, returned in half a minute, carrying in her hand a bun-dle of twigs tied together at one end. This ominous tool she presented to Miss Scatcherd with a respectful curtesy; then she quietly, and without being told, unloosed her pinafore, and the teacher instantly and sharply inflicted on her neck a dozen strokes with the bunch of twigs. Not a tear rose to Burns’ eye; and, while I paused from my sewing, because my fingers quivered at this spectacle with a sentiment of un-availing and impotent anger, not a feature of her pensive face altered its ordinary expression.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Hardened girl!’ exclaimed Miss Scatcherd; ‘nothing can correct you of your slatternly habits: carry the rod away.’<p></p> <p></p> Burns obeyed: I looked at her narrowly as she emerged from the book-closet; she was just putting back her hand-<p></p>  
<p></p> 80	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
kerchief into her pocket, and the trace of a tear glistened on her thin cheek.<p></p> <p></p> The play-hour in the evening I thought the pleasantest fraction of the day at Lowood: the bit of bread, the draught of coffee swallowed at five o’clock had revived vitality, if it had not satisfied hunger: the long restraint of the day was slackened; the schoolroom felt warmer than in the morn-ing—its fires being allowed to burn a little more brightly, to supply, in some measure, the place of candles, not yet introduced: the ruddy gloaming, the licensed uproar, the confusion of many voices gave one a welcome sense of lib-erty.<p></p> <p></p> On the evening of the day on which I had seen Miss Scatcherd flog her pupil, Burns, I wandered as usual among the forms and tables and laughing groups without a com-panion, yet not feeling lonely: when I passed the windows, I now and then lifted a blind, and looked out; it snowed fast, a drift was already forming against the lower panes; putting my ear close to the window, I could distinguish from the gleeful tumult within, the disconsolate moan of the wind outside.<p></p> <p></p> Probably, if I had lately left a good home and kind par-ents, this would have been the hour when I should most keenly have regretted the separation; that wind would then have saddened my heart; this obscure chaos would have disturbed my peace! as it was, I derived from both a strange excitement, and reckless and feverish, I wished the wind to howl more wildly, the gloom to deepen to darkness, and the confusion to rise to clamour.<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	81<p></p>  
Jumping over forms, and creeping under tables, I made my way to one of the fire-places; there, kneeling by the high wire fender, I found Burns, absorbed, silent, abstracted from all round her by the companionship of a book, which she read by the dim glare of the embers.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Is it still ‘Rasselas’?’ I asked, coming behind her. ‘Yes,’ she said, ‘and I have just finished it.’<p></p> <p></p> And in five minutes more she shut it up. I was glad of this. ‘Now,’ thought I, ‘I can perhaps get her to talk.’ I sat down by her on the floor.<p></p> <p></p> ‘What is your name besides Burns?’ ‘Helen.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Do you come a long way from here?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘I come from a place farther north, quite on the borders of Scotland.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Will you ever go back?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘I hope so; but nobody can be sure of the future.’ ‘You must wish to leave Lowood?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘No! why should I? I was sent to Lowood to get an edu-cation; and it would be of no use going away until I have attained that object.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘But that teacher, Miss Scatcherd, is so cruel to you?’ ‘Cruel? Not at all! She is severe: she dislikes my faults.’ ‘And if I were in your place I should dislike her; I should resist her. If she struck me with that rod, I should get it from<p></p> <p></p> her hand; I should break it under her nose.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Probably you would do nothing of the sort: but if you did, Mr. Brocklehurst would expel you from the school; that would be a great grief to your relations. It is far better to<p></p>  
<p></p> 82	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
endure patiently a smart which nobody feels but yourself, than to commit a hasty action whose evil consequences will extend to all connected with you; and besides, the Bible bids us return good for evil.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘But then it seems disgraceful to be flogged, and to be sent to stand in the middle of a room full of people; and you are such a great girl: I am far younger than you, and I could not bear it.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Yet it would be your duty to bear it, if you could not avoid it: it is weak and silly to say you CANNOT BEAR what it is your fate to be required to bear.’<p></p> <p></p> I heard her with wonder: I could not comprehend this doctrine of endurance; and still less could I understand or sympathise with the forbearance she expressed for her chastiser. Still I felt that Helen Burns considered things by a light invisible to my eyes. I suspected she might be right and I wrong; but I would not ponder the matter deeply; like Felix, I put it off to a more convenient season.<p></p> <p></p> ‘You say you have faults, Helen: what are they? To me you seem very good.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Then learn from me, not to judge by appearances: I am, as Miss Scatcherd said, slatternly; I seldom put, and never keep, things, in order; I am careless; I forget rules; I read when I should learn my lessons; I have no method; and sometimes I say, like you, I cannot BEAR to be subjected to systematic arrangements. This is all very provoking to Miss Scatcherd, who is naturally neat, punctual, and particular.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘And cross and cruel,’ I added; but Helen Burns would not admit my addition: she kept silence.<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	83<p></p>  
‘Is Miss Temple as severe to you as Miss Scatcherd?’<p></p> <p></p> At the utterance of Miss Temple’s name, a soft smile flit-ted over her grave face.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Miss Temple is full of goodness; it pains her to be severe to any one, even the worst in the school: she sees my errors, and tells me of them gently; and, if I do anything worthy of praise, she gives me my meed liberally. One strong proof of my wretchedly defective nature is, that even her expostula-tions, so mild, so rational, have not influence to cure me of my faults; and even her praise, though I value it most highly, cannot stimulate me to continued care and foresight.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘That is curious,’ said I, ‘it is so easy to be careful.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘For YOU I have no doubt it is. I observed you in your class this morning, and saw you were closely attentive: your thoughts never seemed to wander while Miss Mill-er explained the lesson and questioned you. Now, mine continually rove away; when I should be listening to Miss Scatcherd, and collecting all she says with assiduity, often I lose the very sound of her voice; I fall into a sort of dream. Sometimes I think I am in Northumberland, and that the noises I hear round me are the bubbling of a little brook which runs through Deepden, near our house;—then, when it comes to my turn to reply, I have to be awakened; and having heard nothing of what was read for listening to the visionary brook, I have no answer ready.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Yet how well you replied this afternoon.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘It was mere chance; the subject on which we had been reading had interested me. This afternoon, instead of dreaming of Deepden, I was wondering how a man who<p></p>  
<p></p> 84	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
wished to do right could act so unjustly and unwisely as Charles the First sometimes did; and I thought what a pity it was that, with his integrity and conscientiousness, he could see no farther than the prerogatives of the crown. If he had but been able to look to a distance, and see how what they call the spirit of the age was tending! Still, I like Charles—I respect him—I pity him, poor murdered king! Yes, his en-emies were the worst: they shed blood they had no right to shed. How dared they kill him!’<p></p> <p></p> Helen was talking to herself now: she had forgotten I could not very well understand her—that I was ignorant, or nearly so, of the subject she discussed. I recalled her to my level.<p></p> <p></p> ‘And when Miss Temple teaches you, do your thoughts wander then?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘No, certainly, not often; because Miss Temple has generally something to say which is newer than my own re-flections; her language is singularly agreeable to me, and the information she communicates is often just what I wished to gain.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Well, then, with Miss Temple you are good?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Yes, in a passive way: I make no effort; I follow as incli-nation guides me. There is no merit in such goodness.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘A great deal: you are good to those who are good to you. It is all I ever desire to be. If people were always kind and obedient to those who are cruel and unjust, the wicked peo-ple would have it all their own way: they would never feel afraid, and so they would never alter, but would grow worse and worse. When we are struck at without a reason, we<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	85<p></p>  
should strike back again very hard; I am sure we should— so hard as to teach the person who struck us never to do it again.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘You will change your mind, I hope, when you grow old-er: as yet you are but a little untaught girl.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘But I feel this, Helen; I must dislike those who, what-ever I do to please them, persist in disliking me; I must resist those who punish me unjustly. It is as natural as that I should love those who show me affection, or submit to pun-ishment when I feel it is deserved.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Heathens and savage tribes hold that doctrine, but Christians and civilised nations disown it.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘How? I don’t understand.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘It is not violence that best overcomes hate—nor ven-geance that most certainly heals injury.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘What then?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Read the New Testament, and observe what Christ says, and how He acts; make His word your rule, and His con-duct your example.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘What does He say?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Love your enemies; bless them that curse you; do good to them that hate you and despitefully use you.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Then I should love Mrs. Reed, which I cannot do; I should bless her son John, which is impossible.’<p></p> <p></p> In her turn, Helen Burns asked me to explain, and I pro-ceeded forthwith to pour out, in my own way, the tale of my sufferings and resentments. Bitter and truculent when ex-cited, I spoke as I felt, without reserve or softening.<p></p> <p></p> Helen heard me patiently to the end: I expected she<p></p>  
<p></p> 86	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
would then make a remark, but she said nothing.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Well,’ I asked impatiently, ‘is not Mrs. Reed a hard-heart-ed, bad woman?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘She has been unkind to you, no doubt; because you see, she dislikes your cast of character, as Miss Scatcherd does mine; but how minutely you remember all she has done and said to you! What a singularly deep impression her injustice seems to have made on your heart! No ill-usage so brands its record on my feelings. Would you not be happier if you tried to forget her severity, together with the passionate emotions it excited? Life appears to me too short to be spent in nursing animosity or registering wrongs. We are, and must be, one and all, burdened with faults in this world: but the time will soon come when, I trust, we shall put them off in putting off our corruptible bodies; when debasement and sin will fall from us with this cumbrous frame of flesh, and only the spark of the spirit will remain,—the impalpable principle of light and thought, pure as when it left the Cre-ator to inspire the creature: whence it came it will return; perhaps again to be communicated to some being higher than man—perhaps to pass through gradations of glory, from the pale human soul to brighten to the seraph! Sure-ly it will never, on the contrary, be suffered to degenerate from man to fiend? No; I cannot believe that: I hold another creed: which no one ever taught me, and which I seldom mention; but in which I delight, and to which I cling: for it extends hope to all: it makes Eternity a rest—a mighty home, not a terror and an abyss. Besides, with this creed, I can so clearly distinguish between the criminal and his<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	87<p></p>  
crime; I can so sincerely forgive the first while I abhor the last: with this creed revenge never worries my heart, degra-dation never too deeply disgusts me, injustice never crushes me too low: I live in calm, looking to the end.’<p></p> <p></p> Helen’s head, always drooping, sank a little lower as she finished this sentence. I saw by her look she wished no longer to talk to me, but rather to converse with her own thoughts. She was not allowed much time for meditation: a monitor, a great rough girl, presently came up, exclaiming in a strong Cumberland accent—<p></p> <p></p> ‘Helen Burns, if you don’t go and put your drawer in order, and fold up your work this minute, I’ll tell Miss Scatcherd to come and look at it!’<p></p> <p></p> Helen sighed as her reverie fled, and getting up, obeyed the monitor without reply as without delay.<p></p>

Chapter VII<p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> My first quarter at Lowood seemed an age; and not the golden age either; it comprised an irksome struggle with difficulties in habituating myself to new rules and un-<p></p> <p></p> wonted tasks. The fear of failure in these points harassed me worse than the physical hardships of my lot; though these were no trifles.<p></p> <p></p> During January, February, and part of March, the deep snows, and, after their melting, the almost impassable roads, prevented our stirring beyond the garden walls, except to go to church; but within these limits we had to pass an hour every day in the open air. Our clothing was insufficient to protect us from the severe cold: we had no boots, the snow got into our shoes and melted there: our ungloved hands be-came numbed and covered with chilblains, as were our feet: I remember well the distracting irritation I endured from this cause every evening, when my feet inflamed; and the torture of thrusting the swelled, raw, and stiff toes into my shoes in the morning. Then the scanty supply of food was distressing: with the keen appetites of growing children, we had scarcely sufficient to keep alive a delicate invalid. From this deficiency of nourishment resulted an abuse, which pressed hardly on the younger pupils: whenever the fam-ished great girls had an opportunity, they would coax or menace the little ones out of their portion. Many a time I<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	89<p></p>  
have shared between two claimants the precious morsel of brown bread distributed at tea-time; and after relinquish-ing to a third half the contents of my mug of coffee, I have swallowed the remainder with an accompaniment of secret tears, forced from me by the exigency of hunger.<p></p> <p></p> Sundays were dreary days in that wintry season. We had to walk two miles to Brocklebridge Church, where our pa-tron officiated. We set out cold, we arrived at church colder: during the morning service we became almost paralysed. It was too far to return to dinner, and an allowance of cold meat and bread, in the same penurious proportion ob-served in our ordinary meals, was served round between the services.<p></p> <p></p> At the close of the afternoon service we returned by an exposed and hilly road, where the bitter winter wind, blow-ing over a range of snowy summits to the north, almost flayed the skin from our faces.<p></p> <p></p> I can remember Miss Temple walking lightly and rap-idly along our drooping line, her plaid cloak, which the frosty wind fluttered, gathered close about her, and encour-aging us, by precept and example, to keep up our spirits, and march forward, as she said, ‘like stalwart soldiers.’ The other teachers, poor things, were generally themselves too much dejected to attempt the task of cheering others.<p></p> <p></p> How we longed for the light and heat of a blazing fire when we got back! But, to the little ones at least, this was denied: each hearth in the schoolroom was immediately surrounded by a double row of great girls, and behind them the younger children crouched in groups, wrapping their<p></p>  
<p></p> 90	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
starved arms in their pinafores.<p></p> <p></p> A little solace came at tea-time, in the shape of a double ration of bread—a whole, instead of a half, slice—with the delicious addition of a thin scrape of butter: it was the heb-domadal treat to which we all looked forward from Sabbath to Sabbath. I generally contrived to reserve a moiety of this bounteous repast for myself; but the remainder I was in-variably obliged to part with.<p></p> <p></p> The Sunday evening was spent in repeating, by heart, the Church Catechism, and the fifth, sixth, and seventh chap-ters of St. Matthew; and in listening to a long sermon, read by Miss Miller, whose irrepressible yawns attested her wea-riness. A frequent interlude of these performances was the enactment of the part of Eutychus by some half-dozen of little girls, who, overpowered with sleep, would fall down, if not out of the third loft, yet off the fourth form, and be taken up half dead. The remedy was, to thrust them for-ward into the centre of the schoolroom, and oblige them to stand there till the sermon was finished. Sometimes their feet failed them, and they sank together in a heap; they were then propped up with the monitors’ high stools.<p></p> <p></p> I have not yet alluded to the visits of Mr. Brocklehu-rst; and indeed that gentleman was from home during the greater part of the first month after my arrival; perhaps pro-longing his stay with his friend the archdeacon: his absence was a relief to me. I need not say that I had my own reasons for dreading his coming: but come he did at last.<p></p> <p></p> One afternoon (I had then been three weeks at Lowood), as I was sitting with a slate in my hand, puzzling over a<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	91<p></p>  
sum in long division, my eyes, raised in abstraction to the window, caught sight of a figure just passing: I recognised almost instinctively that gaunt outline; and when, two min-utes after, all the school, teachers included, rose en masse, it was not necessary for me to look up in order to ascertain whose entrance they thus greeted. A long stride measured the schoolroom, and presently beside Miss Temple, who herself had risen, stood the same black column which had frowned on me so ominously from the hearthrug of Gates-head. I now glanced sideways at this piece of architecture. Yes, I was right: it was Mr. Brocklehurst, buttoned up in a surtout, and looking longer, narrower, and more rigid than ever.<p></p> <p></p> I had my own reasons for being dismayed at this appa-rition; too well I remembered the perfidious hints given by Mrs. Reed about my disposition, &c.; the promise pledged by Mr. Brocklehurst to apprise Miss Temple and the teach-ers of my vicious nature. All along I had been dreading the fulfilment of this promise,—I had been looking out daily for the ‘Coming Man,’ whose information respecting my past life and conversation was to brand me as a bad child for ever: now there he was.<p></p> <p></p> He stood at Miss Temple’s side; he was speaking low in her ear: I did not doubt he was making disclosures of my villainy; and I watched her eye with painful anxiety, expect-ing every moment to see its dark orb turn on me a glance of repugnance and contempt. I listened too; and as I happened to be seated quite at the top of the room, I caught most of what he said: its import relieved me from immediate ap-<p></p>  
<p></p> 92	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
prehension.<p></p> <p></p> ‘I suppose, Miss Temple, the thread I bought at Lowton will do; it struck me that it would be just of the quality for the calico chemises, and I sorted the needles to match. You may tell Miss Smith that I forgot to make a memorandum of the darning needles, but she shall have some papers sent in next week; and she is not, on any account, to give out more than one at a time to each pupil: if they have more, they are apt to be careless and lose them. And, O ma’am! I wish the woollen stockings were better looked to!—when I was here last, I went into the kitchen-garden and examined the clothes drying on the line; there was a quantity of black hose in a very bad state of repair: from the size of the holes in them I was sure they had not been well mended from time to time.’<p></p> <p></p> He paused.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Your directions shall be attended to, sir,’ said Miss Tem-ple.<p></p> <p></p> ‘And, ma’am,’ he continued, ‘the laundress tells me some of the girls have two clean tuckers in the week: it is too much; the rules limit them to one.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘I think I can explain that circumstance, sir. Agnes and Catherine Johnstone were invited to take tea with some friends at Lowton last Thursday, and I gave them leave to put on clean tuckers for the occasion.’<p></p> <p></p> Mr. Brocklehurst nodded.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Well, for once it may pass; but please not to let the cir-cumstance occur too often. And there is another thing which surprised me; I find, in settling accounts with the<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	93<p></p>  
housekeeper, that a lunch, consisting of bread and cheese, has twice been served out to the girls during the past fort-night. How is this? I looked over the regulations, and I find no such meal as lunch mentioned. Who introduced this in-novation? and by what authority?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘I must be responsible for the circumstance, sir,’ replied Miss Temple: ‘the breakfast was so ill prepared that the pu-pils could not possibly eat it; and I dared not allow them to remain fasting till dinner-time.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Madam, allow me an instant. You are aware that my plan in bringing up these girls is, not to accustom them to habits of luxury and indulgence, but to render them hardy, patient, self-denying. Should any little accidental disappointment of the appetite occur, such as the spoiling of a meal, the un-der or the over dressing of a dish, the incident ought not to be neutralised by replacing with something more delicate the comfort lost, thus pampering the body and obviating the aim of this institution; it ought to be improved to the spiritual edification of the pupils, by encouraging them to evince fortitude under temporary privation. A brief address on those occasions would not be mistimed, wherein a judi-cious instructor would take the opportunity of referring to the sufferings of the primitive Christians; to the torments of martyrs; to the exhortations of our blessed Lord Himself, calling upon His disciples to take up their cross and follow Him; to His warnings that man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God; to His divine consolations, ‘If ye suffer hunger or thirst for My sake, happy are ye.’ Oh, madam, when you put bread<p></p>  
<p></p> 94	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
and cheese, instead of burnt porridge, into these children’s mouths, you may indeed feed their vile bodies, but you little think how you starve their immortal souls!’<p></p> <p></p> Mr. Brocklehurst again paused—perhaps overcome by his feelings. Miss Temple had looked down when he first began to speak to her; but she now gazed straight before her, and her face, naturally pale as marble, appeared to be assuming also the coldness and fixity of that material; es-pecially her mouth, closed as if it would have required a sculptor’s chisel to open it, and her brow settled gradually into petrified severity.<p></p> <p></p> Meantime, Mr. Brocklehurst, standing on the hearth with his hands behind his back, majestically surveyed the whole school. Suddenly his eye gave a blink, as if it had met something that either dazzled or shocked its pupil; turning, he said in more rapid accents than he had hitherto used—<p></p> <p></p> ‘Miss Temple, Miss Temple, what—WHAT is that girl with curled hair? Red hair, ma’am, curled—curled all over?’ And extending his cane he pointed to the awful object, his hand shaking as he did so.<p></p> <p></p> ‘It is Julia Severn,’ replied Miss Temple, very quietly. ‘Julia Severn, ma’am! And why has she, or any other,<p></p> <p></p> curled hair? Why, in defiance of every precept and principle of this house, does she conform to the world so openly— here in an evangelical, charitable establishment—as to wear her hair one mass of curls?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Julia’s hair curls naturally,’ returned Miss Temple, still more quietly.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Naturally! Yes, but we are not to conform to nature; I<p></p>

wish these girls to be the children of Grace: and why that abundance? I have again and again intimated that I desire the hair to be arranged closely, modestly, plainly. Miss Tem-ple, that girl’s hair must be cut off entirely; I will send a barber to-morrow: and I see others who have far too much of the excrescence—that tall girl, tell her to turn round. Tell all the first form to rise up and direct their faces to the wall.’<p></p> <p></p> Miss Temple passed her handkerchief over her lips, as if to smooth away the involuntary smile that curled them; she gave the order, however, and when the first class could take in what was required of them, they obeyed. Leaning a little back on my bench, I could see the looks and grimaces with which they commented on this manoeuvre: it was a pity Mr. Brocklehurst could not see them too; he would perhaps have felt that, whatever he might do with the outside of the cup and platter, the inside was further beyond his interfer-ence than he imagined.<p></p> <p></p> He scrutinised the reverse of these living medals some five minutes, then pronounced sentence. These words fell like the knell of doom—<p></p> <p></p> ‘All those top -knots must be cut off.’ Miss Temple seemed to remonstrate.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Madam,’ he pursued, ‘I have a Master to serve whose kingdom is not of this world: my mission is to mortify in these girls the lusts of the flesh; to teach them to clothe themselves with shame-facedness and sobriety, not with braided hair and costly apparel; and each of the young per-sons before us has a string of hair twisted in plaits which<p></p>  
<p></p> 96	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
vanity itself might have woven; these, I repeat, must be cut off; think of the time wasted, of—‘<p></p> <p></p> Mr. Brocklehurst was here interrupted: three other vis-itors, ladies, now entered the room. They ought to have come a little sooner to have heard his lecture on dress, for they were splendidly attired in velvet, silk, and furs. The two younger of the trio (fine girls of sixteen and seventeen) had grey beaver hats, then in fashion, shaded with ostrich plumes, and from under the brim of this graceful head-dress fell a profusion of light tresses, elaborately curled; the elder lady was enveloped in a costly velvet shawl, trimmed with ermine, and she wore a false front of French curls.<p></p> <p></p> These ladies were deferentially received by Miss Tem-ple, as Mrs. and the Misses Brocklehurst, and conducted to seats of honour at the top of the room. It seems they had come in the carriage with their reverend relative, and had been conducting a rummaging scrutiny of the room up-stairs, while he transacted business with the housekeeper, questioned the laundress, and lectured the superintendent. They now proceeded to address divers remarks and reproofs to Miss Smith, who was charged with the care of the linen and the inspection of the dormitories: but I had no time to listen to what they said; other matters called off and en-chanted my attention.<p></p> <p></p> Hitherto, while gathering up the discourse of Mr. Brock-lehurst and Miss Temple, I had not, at the same time, neglected precautions to secure my personal safety; which I thought would be effected, if I could only elude observa-tion. To this end, I had sat well back on the form, and while<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	97<p></p>  
seeming to be busy with my sum, had held my slate in such a manner as to conceal my face: I might have escaped no-tice, had not my treacherous slate somehow happened to slip from my hand, and falling with an obtrusive crash, di-rectly drawn every eye upon me; I knew it was all over now, and, as I stooped to pick up the two fragments of slate, I ral-lied my forces for the worst. It came.<p></p> <p></p> ‘A careless girl!’ said Mr. Brocklehurst, and immediately after—‘It is the new pupil, I perceive.’ And before I could draw breath, ‘I must not forget I have a word to say respect-ing her.’ Then aloud: how loud it seemed to me! ‘Let the child who broke her slate come forward!’<p></p> <p></p> Of my own accord I could not have stirred; I was para-lysed: but the two great girls who sit on each side of me, set me on my legs and pushed me towards the dread judge, and then Miss Temple gently assisted me to his very feet, and I caught her whispered counsel—<p></p> <p></p> ‘Don’t be afraid, Jane, I saw it was an accident; you shall not be punished.’<p></p> <p></p> The kind whisper went to my heart like a dagger. ‘Another minute, and she will despise me for a hypocrite,’<p></p> <p></p> thought I; and an impulse of fury against Reed, Brocklehu-rst, and Co. bounded in my pulses at the conviction. I was no Helen Burns.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Fetch that stool,’ said Mr. Brocklehurst, pointing to a very high one from which a monitor had just risen: it was brought.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Place the child upon it.’<p></p> <p></p> And I was placed there, by whom I don’t know: I was in<p></p>  
<p></p> 98	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
no condition to note particulars; I was only aware that they had hoisted me up to the height of Mr. Brocklehurst’s nose, that he was within a yard of me, and that a spread of shot orange and purple silk pelisses and a cloud of silvery plum-age extended and waved below me.<p></p> <p></p> Mr. Brocklehurst hemmed.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Ladies,’ said he, turning to his family, ‘Miss Temple, teachers, and children, you all see this girl?’<p></p> <p></p> Of course they did; for I felt their eyes directed like burn-ing- glasses against my scorched skin.<p></p> <p></p> ‘You see she is yet young; you observe she possesses the ordinary form of childhood; God has graciously given her the shape that He has given to all of us; no signal deformity points her out as a marked character. Who would think that the Evil One had already found a servant and agent in her? Yet such, I grieve to say, is the case.’<p></p> <p></p> A pause—in which I began to steady the palsy of my nerves, and to feel that the Rubicon was passed; and that the trial, no longer to be shirked, must be firmly sustained.<p></p> <p></p> ‘My dear children,’ pursued the black marble clergyman, with pathos, ‘this is a sad, a melancholy occasion; for it be-comes my duty to warn you, that this girl, who might be one of God’s own lambs, is a little castaway: not a member of the true flock, but evidently an interloper and an alien. You must be on your guard against her; you must shun her example; if necessary, avoid her company, exclude her from your sports, and shut her out from your converse. Teach-ers, you must watch her: keep your eyes on her movements, weigh well her words, scrutinise her actions, punish her<p></p>

body to save her soul: if, indeed, such salvation be possible, for (my tongue falters while I tell it) this girl, this child, the native of a Christian land, worse than many a little heathen who says its prayers to Brahma and kneels before Jugger-naut—this girl is—a liar!’<p></p> <p></p> Now came a pause of ten minutes, during which I, by this time in perfect possession of my wits, observed all the female Brocklehursts produce their pocket-handker-chiefs and apply them to their optics, while the elderly lady swayed herself to and fro, and the two younger ones whis-pered, ‘How shocking!’ Mr. Brocklehurst resumed.<p></p> <p></p> ‘This I learned from her benefactress; from the pious and charitable lady who adopted her in her orphan state, reared her as her own daughter, and whose kindness, whose gen-erosity the unhappy girl repaid by an ingratitude so bad, so dreadful, that at last her excellent patroness was obliged to separate her from her own young ones, fearful lest her vicious example should contaminate their purity: she has sent her here to be healed, even as the Jews of old sent their diseased to the troubled pool of Bethesda; and, teachers, superintendent, I beg of you not to allow the waters to stag-nate round her.’<p></p> <p></p> With this sublime conclusion, Mr. Brocklehurst adjusted the top button of his surtout, muttered something to his family, who rose, bowed to Miss Temple, and then all the great people sailed in state from the room. Turning at the door, my judge said—<p></p> <p></p> ‘Let her stand half-an-hour longer on that stool, and let no one speak to her during the remainder of the day.’<p></p>  
<p></p> 100	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
There was I, then, mounted aloft; I, who had said I could not bear the shame of standing on my natural feet in the middle of the room, was now exposed to general view on a pedestal of infamy. What my sensations were no language can describe; but just as they all rose, stifling my breath and constricting my throat, a girl came up and passed me: in passing, she lifted her eyes. What a strange light in-spired them! What an extraordinary sensation that ray sent through me! How the new feeling bore me up! It was as if a martyr, a hero, had passed a slave or victim, and imparted strength in the transit. I mastered the rising hysteria, lifted up my head, and took a firm stand on the stool. Helen Burns asked some slight question about her work of Miss Smith, was chidden for the triviality of the inquiry, returned to her place, and smiled at me as she again went by. What a smile! I remember it now, and I know that it was the effluence of fine intellect, of true courage; it lit up her marked lineaments, her thin face, her sunken grey eye, like a reflection from the aspect of an angel. Yet at that moment Helen Burns wore on her arm ‘the untidy badge;’ scarcely an hour ago I had heard her condemned by Miss Scatcherd to a dinner of bread and water on the morrow because she had blotted an exercise in copying it out. Such is the imperfect nature of man! such spots are there on the disc of the clearest planet; and eyes like Miss Scatcherd’s can only see those minute defects, and are blind to the full brightness of the orb.<p></p>

Chapter VIII<p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> Ere the half-hour ended, five o’clock struck; school was dismissed, and all were gone into the refectory to tea. I now ventured to descend: it was deep dusk; I retired into a corner and sat down on the floor. The spell by which I had been so far supported began to dissolve; reaction took place, and soon, so overwhelming was the grief that seized me, I sank prostrate with my face to the ground. Now I wept: Helen Burns was not here; nothing sustained me; left to my-self I abandoned myself, and my tears watered the boards. I had meant to be so good, and to do so much at Lowood: to make so many friends, to earn respect and win affection. Already I had made visible progress: that very morning I had reached the head of my class; Miss Miller had praised me warmly; Miss Temple had smiled approbation; she had promised to teach me drawing, and to let me learn French, if I continued to make similar improvement two months longer: and then I was well received by my fellow-pupils; treated as an equal by those of my own age, and not mo-lested by any; now, here I lay again crushed and trodden on;<p></p> <p></p> and could I ever rise more?<p></p> <p></p> ‘Never,’ I thought; and ardently I wished to die. While sobbing out this wish in broken accents, some one ap-proached: I started up— again Helen Burns was near me; the fading fires just showed her coming up the long, vacant<p></p>  
<p></p> 102	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
room; she brought my coffee and bread.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Come, eat something,’ she said; but I put both away from me, feeling as if a drop or a crumb would have choked me in my present condition. Helen regarded me, probably with surprise: I could not now abate my agitation, though I tried hard; I continued to weep aloud. She sat down on the ground near me, embraced her knees with her arms, and rested her head upon them; in that attitude she remained silent as an Indian. I was the first who spoke—<p></p> <p></p> ‘Helen, why do you stay with a girl whom everybody be-lieves to be a liar?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Everybody, Jane? Why, there are only eighty people who have heard you called so, and the world contains hundreds of millions.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘But what have I to do with millions? The eighty, I know, despise me.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Jane, you are mistaken: probably not one in the school either despises or dislikes you: many, I am sure, pity you much.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘How can they pity me after what Mr. Brocklehurst has said?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Mr. Brocklehurst is not a god: nor is he even a great and admired man: he is little liked here; he never took steps to make himself liked. Had he treated you as an especial favourite, you would have found enemies, declared or co-vert, all around you; as it is, the greater number would offer you sympathy if they dared. Teachers and pupils may look coldly on you for a day or two, but friendly feelings are con-cealed in their hearts; and if you persevere in doing well,<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	103<p></p>  
these feelings will ere long appear so much the more evi-dently for their temporary suppression. Besides, Jane’—she paused.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Well, Helen?’ said I, putting my hand into hers: she chafed my fingers gently to warm them, and went on—<p></p> <p></p> ‘If all the world hated you, and believed you wicked, while your own conscience approved you, and absolved you from guilt, you would not be without friends.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘No; I know I should think well of myself; but that is not enough: if others don’t love me I would rather die than live—I cannot bear to be solitary and hated, Helen. Look here; to gain some real affection from you, or Miss Temple, or any other whom I truly love, I would willingly submit to have the bone of my arm broken, or to let a bull toss me, or to stand behind a kicking horse, and let it dash its hoof at my chest—‘<p></p> <p></p> ‘Hush, Jane! you think too much of the love of human beings; you are too impulsive, too vehement; the sover-eign hand that created your frame, and put life into it, has provided you with other resources than your feeble self, or than creatures feeble as you. Besides this earth, and besides the race of men, there is an invisible world and a kingdom of spirits: that world is round us, for it is everywhere; and those spirits watch us, for they are commissioned to guard us; and if we were dying in pain and shame, if scorn smote us on all sides, and hatred crushed us, angels see our tor-tures, recognise our innocence (if innocent we be: as I know you are of this charge which Mr. Brocklehurst has weakly and pompously repeated at second-hand from Mrs.<p></p>  
<p></p> 104	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
Reed; for I read a sincere nature in your ardent eyes and on your clear front), and God waits only the separation of spirit from flesh to crown us with a full reward. Why, then, should we ever sink overwhelmed with distress, when life is so soon over, and death is so certain an entrance to hap-piness— to glory?’<p></p> <p></p> I was silent; Helen had calmed me; but in the tranquil-lity she imparted there was an alloy of inexpressible sadness. I felt the impression of woe as she spoke, but I could not tell whence it came; and when, having done speaking, she breathed a little fast and coughed a short cough, I momen-tarily forgot my own sorrows to yield to a vague concern for her.<p></p> <p></p> Resting my head on Helen’s shoulder, I put my arms round her waist; she drew me to her, and we reposed in si-lence. We had not sat long thus, when another person came in. Some heavy clouds, swept from the sky by a rising wind, had left the moon bare; and her light, streaming in through a window near, shone full both on us and on the approach-ing figure, which we at once recognised as Miss Temple.<p></p> <p></p> ‘I came on purpose to find you, Jane Eyre,’ said she; ‘I want you in my room; and as Helen Burns is with you, she may come too.’<p></p> <p></p> We went; following the superintendent’s guidance, we had to thread some intricate passages, and mount a stair-case before we reached her apartment; it contained a good fire, and looked cheerful. Miss Temple told Helen Burns to be seated in a low arm-chair on one side of the hearth, and herself taking another, she called me to her side.<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	105<p></p>  
‘Is it all over?’ she asked, looking down at my face. ‘Have you cried your grief away?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘I am afraid I never shall do that.’ ‘Why?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Because I have been wrongly accused; and you, ma’am, and everybody else, will now think me wicked.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘We shall think you what you prove yourself to be, my child. Continue to act as a good girl, and you will satisfy us.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Shall I, Miss Temple?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘You will,’ said she, passing her arm round me. ‘And now tell me who is the lady whom Mr. Brocklehurst called your benefactress?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Mrs. Reed, my uncle’s wife. My uncle is dead, and he left me to her care.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Did she not, then, adopt you of her own accord?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘No, ma’am; she was sorry to have to do it: but my uncle, as I have often heard the servants say, got her to promise be-fore he died that she would always keep me.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Well now, Jane, you know, or at least I will tell you, that when a criminal is accused, he is always allowed to speak in his own defence. You have been charged with falsehood; defend yourself to me as well as you can. Say whatever your memory suggests is true; but add nothing and exaggerate nothing.’<p></p> <p></p> I resolved, in the depth of my heart, that I would be most moderatemost correct; and, having reflected a few minutes in order to arrange coherently what I had to say, I told her all the story of my sad childhood. Exhausted by emotion,<p></p>  
<p></p> 106	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
my language was more subdued than it generally was when it developed that sad theme; and mindful of Helen’s warn-ings against the indulgence of resentment, I infused into the narrative far less of gall and wormwood than ordinary. Thus restrained and simplified, it sounded more credible: I felt as I went on that Miss Temple fully believed me.<p></p> <p></p> In the course of the tale I had mentioned Mr. Lloyd as having come to see me after the fit: for I never forgot the, to me, frightful episode of the red-room: in detailing which, my excitement was sure, in some degree, to break bounds; for nothing could soften in my recollection the spasm of ag-ony which clutched my heart when Mrs. Reed spurned my wild supplication for pardon, and locked me a second time in the dark and haunted chamber.<p></p> <p></p> I had finished: Miss Temple regarded me a few minutes in silence; she then said—<p></p> <p></p> ‘I know something of Mr. Lloyd; I shall write to him; if his reply agrees with your statement, you shall be publicly cleared from every imputation; to me, Jane, you are clear now.’<p></p> <p></p> She kissed me, and still keeping me at her side (where I was well contented to stand, for I derived a child’s pleasure from the contemplation of her face, her dress, her one or two ornaments, her white forehead, her clustered and shin-ing curls, and beaming dark eyes), she proceeded to address Helen Burns.<p></p> <p></p> ‘How are you to-night, Helen? Have you coughed much to-day?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Not quite so much, I think, ma’am.’<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	107<p></p>  
‘And the pain in your chest?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘It is a little better.’<p></p> <p></p> Miss Temple got up, took her hand and examined her pulse; then she returned to her own seat: as she resumed it, I heard her sigh low. She was pensive a few minutes, then rousing herself, she said cheerfully—<p></p> <p></p> ‘But you two are my visitors to-night; I must treat you as such.’ She rang her bell.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Barbara,’ she said to the servant who answered it, ‘I have not yet had tea; bring the tray and place cups for these two young ladies.’<p></p> <p></p> And a tray was soon brought. How pretty, to my eyes, did the china cups and bright teapot look, placed on the little round table near the fire! How fragrant was the steam of the beverage, and the scent of the toast! of which, however, I, to my dismay (for I was beginning to be hungry) discerned only a very small portion: Miss Temple discerned it too.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Barbara,’ said she, ‘can you not bring a little more bread and butter? There is not enough for three.’<p></p> <p></p> Barbara went out: she returned soon—<p></p> <p></p> ‘Madam, Mrs. Harden says she has sent up the usual quantity.’<p></p> <p></p> Mrs. Harden, be it observed, was the housekeeper: a woman after Mr. Brocklehurst’s own heart, made up of equal parts of whalebone and iron.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Oh, very well!’ returned Miss Temple; ‘we must make it do, Barbara, I suppose.’ And as the girl withdrew she added, smiling, ‘Fortunately, I have it in my power to supply defi-ciencies for this once.’<p></p>  
<p></p> 108	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
Having invited Helen and me to approach the table, and placed before each of us a cup of tea with one delicious but thin morsel of toast, she got up, unlocked a drawer, and tak-ing from it a parcel wrapped in paper, disclosed presently to our eyes a good-sized seed-cake.<p></p> <p></p> ‘I meant to give each of you some of this to take with you,’ said she, ‘but as there is so little toast, you must have it now,’ and she proceeded to cut slices with a generous hand.<p></p> <p></p> We feasted that evening as on nectar and ambrosia; and not the least delight of the entertainment was the smile of gratification with which our hostess regarded us, as we satisfied our famished appetites on the delicate fare she lib-erally supplied.<p></p> <p></p> Tea over and the tray removed, she again summoned us to the fire; we sat one on each side of her, and now a conver-sation followed between her and Helen, which it was indeed a privilege to be admitted to hear.<p></p> <p></p> Miss Temple had always something of serenity in her air, of state in her mien, of refined propriety in her language, which precluded deviation into the ardent, the excited, the eager: something which chastened the pleasure of those who looked on her and listened to her, by a controlling sense of awe; and such was my feeling now: but as to Helen Burns, I was struck with wonder.<p></p> <p></p> The refreshing meal, the brilliant fire, the presence and kindness of her beloved instructress, or, perhaps, more than all these, something in her own unique mind, had roused her powers within her. They woke, they kindled: first, they glowed in the bright tint of her cheek, which till this hour<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	109<p></p>  
I had never seen but pale and bloodless; then they shone in the liquid lustre of her eyes, which had suddenly acquired a beauty more singular than that of Miss Temple’s—a beauty neither of fine colour nor long eyelash, nor pencilled brow, but of meaning, of movement, of radiance. Then her soul sat on her lips, and language flowed, from what source I cannot tell. Has a girl of fourteen a heart large enough, vigorous enough, to hold the swelling spring of pure, full, fervid elo-quence? Such was the characteristic of Helen’s discourse on that, to me, memorable evening; her spirit seemed hasten-ing to live within a very brief span as much as many live during a protracted existence.<p></p> <p></p> They conversed of things I had never heard of; of na-tions and times past; of countries far away; of secrets of nature discovered or guessed at: they spoke of books: how many they had read! What stores of knowledge they pos-sessed! Then they seemed so familiar with French names and French authors: but my amazement reached its climax when Miss Temple asked Helen if she sometimes snatched a moment to recall the Latin her father had taught her, and taking a book from a shelf, bade her read and construe a page of Virgil; and Helen obeyed, my organ of veneration expanding at every sounding line. She had scarcely finished ere the bell announced bedtime! no delay could be admit-ted; Miss Temple embraced us both, saying, as she drew us to her heart—<p></p> <p></p> ‘God bless you, my children!’<p></p> <p></p> Helen she held a little longer than me: she let her go more reluctantly; it was Helen her eye followed to the door; it was<p></p>  
<p></p> 110	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
for her she a second time breathed a sad sigh; for her she wiped a tear from her cheek.<p></p> <p></p> On reaching the bedroom, we heard the voice of Miss Scatcherd: she was examining drawers; she had just pulled out Helen Burns’s, and when we entered Helen was greet-ed with a sharp reprimand, and told that to-morrow she should have half-a-dozen of untidily folded articles pinned to her shoulder.<p></p> <p></p> ‘My things were indeed in shameful disorder,’ murmured Helen to me, in a low voice: ‘I intended to have arranged them, but I forgot.’<p></p> <p></p> Next morning, Miss Scatcherd wrote in conspicuous characters on a piece of pasteboard the word ‘Slattern,’ and bound it like a phylactery round Helen’s large, mild, intelli-gent, and benign- looking forehead. She wore it till evening, patient, unresentful, regarding it as a deserved punishment. The moment Miss Scatcherd withdrew after afternoon school, I ran to Helen, tore it off, and thrust it into the fire: the fury of which she was incapable had been burning in my soul all day, and tears, hot and large, had continually been scalding my cheek; for the spectacle of her sad resignation gave me an intolerable pain at the heart.<p></p> <p></p> About a week subsequently to the incidents above nar-rated, Miss Temple, who had written to Mr. Lloyd, received his answer: it appeared that what he said went to corrobo-rate my account. Miss Temple, having assembled the whole school, announced that inquiry had been made into the charges alleged against Jane Eyre, and that she was most happy to be able to pronounce her completely cleared from<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	111<p></p>  
every imputation. The teachers then shook hands with me and kissed me, and a murmur of pleasure ran through the ranks of my companions.<p></p> <p></p> Thus relieved of a grievous load, I from that hour set to work afresh, resolved to pioneer my way through every dif-ficulty: I toiled hard, and my success was proportionate to my efforts; my memory, not naturally tenacious, improved with practice; exercise sharpened my wits; in a few weeks I was promoted to a higher class; in less than two months I was allowed to commence French and drawing. I learned the first two tenses of the verb ETRE, and sketched my first cottage (whose walls, by-the-bye, outrivalled in slope those of the leaning tower of Pisa), on the same day. That night, on going to bed, I forgot to prepare in imagination the Barmecide supper of hot roast potatoes, or white bread and new milk, with which I was wont to amuse my inward cravings: I feasted instead on the spectacle of ideal draw-ings, which I saw in the dark; all the work of my own hands: freely pencilled houses and trees, picturesque rocks and ruins, Cuyp-like groups of cattle, sweet paintings of butter-flies hovering over unblown roses, of birds picking at ripe cherries, of wren’s nests enclosing pearl-like eggs, wreathed about with young ivy sprays. I examined, too, in thought, the possibility of my ever being able to translate currently a certain little French story which Madame Pierrot had that day shown me; nor was that problem solved to my satisfac-tion ere I fell sweetly asleep.<p></p> <p></p> Well has Solomon said—‘Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a stalled ox and hatred therewith.’<p></p>

I would not now have exchanged Lowood with all its pri-vations for Gateshead and its daily luxuries.<p></p>  
<p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	113<p></p>  
Chapter IX<p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> But the privations, or rather the hardships, of Lowood lessened. Spring drew on: she was indeed already come; the frosts of winter had ceased; its snows were melted, its cutting winds ameliorated. My wretched feet, flayed and swollen to lameness by the sharp air of January, began to heal and subside under the gentler breathings of April; the nights and mornings no longer by their Canadian tempera-ture froze the very blood in our veins; we could now endure the play-hour passed in the garden: sometimes on a sunny day it began even to be pleasant and genial, and a green-ness grew over those brown beds, which, freshening daily, suggested the thought that Hope traversed them at night, and left  each morning brighter traces of her steps. Flow-ers peeped out amongst the leaves; snow- drops, crocuses, purple auriculas, and golden-eyed pansies. On Thursday af-ternoons (half-holidays) we now took walks, and found still<p></p> <p></p> sweeter flowers opening by the wayside, under the hedges. I discovered, too, that a great pleasure, an enjoyment which the horizon only bounded, lay all outside the high and spike-guarded walls of our garden: this pleasure consisted in prospect of noble summits girdling a great hill-hollow, rich in verdure and shadow; in a bright beck, full of dark stones and sparkling eddies. How different had this scene looked when I viewed it laid out beneath the iron sky<p></p>  
<p></p> 114	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
of winter, stiffened in frost, shrouded with snow!— when mists as chill as death wandered to the impulse of east winds along those purple peaks, and rolled down ‘ing’ and holm till they blended with the frozen fog of the beck! That beck itself was then a torrent, turbid and curbless: it tore asunder the wood, and sent a raving sound through the air, often thickened with wild rain or whirling sleet; and for the forest on its banks, THAT showed only ranks of skeletons.<p></p> <p></p> April advanced to May: a bright serene May it was; days of blue sky, placid sunshine, and soft western or southern gales filled up its duration. And now vegetation matured with vigour; Lowood shook loose its tresses; it became all green, all flowery; its great elm, ash, and oak skeletons were restored to majestic life; woodland plants sprang up pro-fusely in its recesses; unnumbered varieties of moss filled its hollows, and it made a strange ground-sunshine out of the wealth of its wild primrose plants: I have seen their pale gold gleam in overshadowed spots like scatterings of the sweetest lustre. All this I enjoyed often and fully, free, un-watched, and almost alone: for this unwonted liberty and pleasure there was a cause, to which it now becomes my task to advert.<p></p> <p></p> Have I not described a pleasant site for a dwelling, when I speak of it as bosomed in hill and wood, and rising from the verge of a stream? Assuredly, pleasant enough: but whether healthy or not is another question.<p></p> <p></p> That forest-dell, where Lowood lay, was the cradle of fog and fog- bred pestilence; which, quickening with the quick-ening spring, crept into the Orphan Asylum, breathed<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	115<p></p>  
typhus through its crowded schoolroom and dormitory, and, ere May arrived, transformed the seminary into an hospital.<p></p> <p></p> Semi-starvation and neglected colds had predisposed most of the pupils to receive infection: forty-five out of the eighty girls lay ill at one time. Classes were broken up, rules relaxed. The few who continued well were allowed almost unlimited license; because the medical attendant insisted on the necessity of frequent exercise to keep them in health: and had it been otherwise, no one had leisure to watch or restrain them. Miss Temple’s whole attention was absorbed by the patients: she lived in the sick-room, never quitting it except to snatch a few hours’ rest at night. The teachers were fully occupied with packing up and making other necessary preparations for the departure of those girls who were for-tunate enough to have friends and relations able and willing to remove them from the seat of contagion. Many, already smitten, went home only to die: some died at the school, and were buried quietly and quickly, the nature of the mal-ady forbidding delay.<p></p> <p></p> While disease had thus become an inhabitant of Lowood, and death its frequent visitor; while there was gloom and fear within its walls; while its rooms and passages steamed with hospital smells, the drug and the pastille striving vainly to overcome the effluvia of mortality, that bright May shone unclouded over the bold hills and beautiful woodland out of doors. Its garden, too, glowed with flowers: hollyhocks had sprung up tall as trees, lilies had opened, tulips and ros-es were in bloom; the borders of the little beds were gay with<p></p>  
<p></p> 116	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
pink thrift and crimson double daisies; the sweetbriars gave out, morning and evening, their scent of spice and apples; and these fragrant treasures were all useless for most of the inmates of Lowood, except to furnish now and then a hand-ful of herbs and blossoms to put in a coffin.<p></p> <p></p> But I, and the rest who continued well, enjoyed ful-ly the beauties of the scene and season; they let us ramble in the wood, like gipsies, from morning till night; we did what we liked, went where we liked: we lived better too. Mr. Brocklehurst and his family never came near Lowood now: household matters were not scrutinised into; the cross housekeeper was gone, driven away by the fear of infection; her successor, who had been matron at the Lowton Dispen-sary, unused to the ways of her new abode, provided with comparative liberality. Besides, there were fewer to feed; the sick could eat little; our breakfast-basins were better filled; when there was no time to prepare a regular dinner, which often happened, she would give us a large piece of cold pie, or a thick slice of bread and cheese, and this we carried away with us to the wood, where we each chose the spot we liked best, and dined sumptuously.<p></p> <p></p> My favourite seat was a smooth and broad stone, rising white and dry from the very middle of the beck, and only to be got at by wading through the water; a feat I accomplished barefoot. The stone was just broad enough to accommodate, comfortably, another girl and me, at that time my chosen comrade—one Mary Ann Wilson; a shrewd, observant per-sonage, whose society I took pleasure in, partly because she was witty and original, and partly because she had a man-<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	117<p></p>  
ner which set me at my ease. Some years older than I, she knew more of the world, and could tell me many things I liked to hear: with her my curiosity found gratification: to my faults also she gave ample indulgence, never imposing curb or rein on anything I said. She had a turn for narrative, I for analysis; she liked to inform, I to question; so we got on swimmingly together, deriving much entertainment, if not much improvement, from our mutual intercourse.<p></p> <p></p> And where, meantime, was Helen Burns? Why did I not spend these sweet days of liberty with her? Had I forgotten her? or was I so worthless as to have grown tired of her pare society? Surely the Mary Arm Wilson I have mentioned was inferior to my first acquaintance: she could only tell me amusing stories, and reciprocate any racy and pungent gos-sip I chose to indulge in; while, if I have spoken truth of Helen, she was qualified to give those who enjoyed the priv-ilege of her converse a taste of far higher things.<p></p> <p></p> True, reader; and I knew and felt this: and though I am a defective being, with many faults and few redeeming points, yet I never tired of Helen Burns; nor ever ceased to cher-ish for her a sentiment of attachment, as strong, tender, and respectful as any that ever animated my heart. How could it be otherwise, when Helen, at all times and under all cir-cumstances, evinced for me a quiet and faithful friendship, which ill-humour never soured, nor irritation never trou-bled? But Helen was ill at present: for some weeks she had been removed from my sight to I knew not what room up-stairs. She was not, I was told, in the hospital portion of the house with the fever patients; for her complaint was<p></p>  
<p></p> 118	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
consumption, not typhus: and by consumption I, in my ig-norance, understood something mild, which time and care would be sure to alleviate.<p></p> <p></p> I was confirmed in this idea by the fact of her once or twice coming downstairs on very warm sunny afternoons, and being taken by Miss Temple into the garden; but, on these occasions, I was not allowed to go and speak to her; I only saw her from the schoolroom window, and then not distinctly; for she was much wrapped up, and sat at a dis-tance under the verandah.<p></p> <p></p> One evening, in the beginning of June, I had stayed out very late with Mary Ann in the wood; we had, as usual, sep-arated ourselves from the others, and had wandered far; so far that we lost our way, and had to ask it at a lonely cottage, where a man and woman lived, who looked after a herd of half-wild swine that fed on the mast in the wood. When we got back, it was after moonrise: a pony, which we knew to be the surgeon’s, was standing at the garden door. Mary Ann remarked that she supposed some one must be very ill, as Mr. Bates had been sent for at that time of the evening. She went into the house; I stayed behind a few minutes to plant in my garden a handful of roots I had dug up in the forest, and which I feared would wither if I left them till the morn-ing. This done, I lingered yet a little longer: the flowers smelt so sweet as the dew fell; it was such a pleasant evening, so serene, so warm; the still glowing west promised so fairly another fine day on the morrow; the moon rose with such majesty in the grave east. I was noting these things and en-joying them as a child might, when it entered my mind as it<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	119<p></p>  
had never done before:-<p></p> <p></p> ‘How sad to be lying now on a sick bed, and to be in dan-ger of dying! This world is pleasant—it would be dreary to be called from it, and to have to go who knows where?’<p></p> <p></p> And then my mind made its first earnest effort to com-prehend what had been infused into it concerning heaven and hell; and for the first time it recoiled, baffled; and for the first time glancing behind, on each side, and before it, it saw all round an unfathomed gulf: it felt the one point where it stood—the present; all the rest was formless cloud and vacant depth; and it shuddered at the thought of totter-ing, and plunging amid that chaos. While pondering this new idea, I heard the front door open; Mr. Bates came out, and with him was a nurse. After she had seen him mount his horse and depart, she was about to close the door, but I ran up to her.<p></p> <p></p> ‘How is Helen Burns?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Very poorly,’ was the answer.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Is it her Mr. Bates has been to see?’ ‘Yes.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘And what does he say about her?’ ‘He says she’ll not be here long.’<p></p> <p></p> This phrase, uttered in my hearing yesterday, would have only conveyed the notion that she was about to be removed to Northumberland, to her own home. I should not have suspected that it meant she was dying; but I knew instant-ly now! It opened clear on my comprehension that Helen Burns was numbering her last days in this world, and that she was going to be taken to the region of spirits, if such<p></p>  
<p></p> 120	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
region there were. I experienced a shock of horror, then a strong thrill of grief, then a desire—a necessity to see her; and I asked in what room she lay.<p></p> <p></p> ‘She is in Miss Temple’s room,’ said the nurse.<p></p> <p></p> ‘May I go up and speak to her?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Oh no, child! It is not likely; and now it is time for you to come in; you’ll catch the fever if you stop out when the dew is falling.’<p></p> <p></p> The nurse closed the front door; I went in by the side en-trance which led to the schoolroom: I was just in time; it was nine o’clock, and Miss Miller was calling the pupils to go to bed.<p></p> <p></p> It might be two hours later, probably near eleven, when I—not having been able to fall asleep, and deeming, from the perfect silence of the dormitory, that my companions were all wrapt in profound repose—rose softly, put on my frock over my night-dress, and, without shoes, crept from the apartment, and set off in quest of Miss Temple’s room. It was quite at the other end of the house; but I knew my way; and the light of the unclouded summer moon, enter-ing here and there at passage windows, enabled me to find it without difficulty. An odour of camphor and burnt vin-egar warned me when I came near the fever room: and I passed its door quickly, fearful lest the nurse who sat up all night should hear me. I dreaded being discovered and sent back; for I MUST see Helen,—I must embrace her before she died,—I must give her one last kiss, exchange with her one last word.<p></p> <p></p> Having descended a staircase, traversed a portion of the<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	121<p></p>  
house below, and succeeded in opening and shutting, with-out noise, two doors, I reached another flight of steps; these I mounted, and then just opposite to me was Miss Temple’s room. A light shone through the keyhole and from under the door; a profound stillness pervaded the vicinity. Com-ing near, I found the door slightly ajar; probably to admit some fresh air into the close abode of sickness. Indisposed to hesitate, and full of impatient impulses—soul and senses quivering with keen throes—I put it back and looked in. My eye sought Helen, and feared to find death.<p></p> <p></p> Close by Miss Temple’s bed, and half covered with its white curtains, there stood a little crib. I saw the outline of a form under the clothes, but the face was hid by the hangings: the nurse I had spoken to in the garden sat in an easy- chair asleep; an unsnuffed candle burnt dimly on the table. Miss Temple was not to be seen: I knew afterwards that she had been called to a delirious patient in the fever-room. I ad-vanced; then paused by the crib side: my hand was on the curtain, but I preferred speaking before I withdrew it. I still recoiled at the dread of seeing a corpse.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Helen!’ I whispered softly, ‘are you awake?’<p></p> <p></p> She stirred herself, put back the curtain, and I saw her face, pale, wasted, but quite composed: she looked so little changed that my fear was instantly dissipated.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Can it be you, Jane?’ she asked, in her own gentle voice. ‘Oh!’ I thought, ‘she is not going to die; they are mistak-<p></p> <p></p> en: she could not speak and look so calmly if she were.’<p></p> <p></p> I got on to her crib and kissed her: her forehead was cold, and her cheek both cold and thin, and so were her hand and<p></p>  
<p></p> 122	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
wrist; but she smiled as of old.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Why are you come here, Jane? It is past eleven o’clock: I heard it strike some minutes since.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘I came to see you, Helen: I heard you were very ill, and I could not sleep till I had spoken to you.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘You came to bid me good-bye, then: you are just in time probably.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Are you going somewhere, Helen? Are you going home?’ ‘Yes; to my long home—my last home.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘No, no, Helen!’ I stopped, distressed. While I tried to devour my tears, a fit of coughing seized Helen; it did not, however, wake the nurse; when it was over, she lay some minutes exhausted; then she whispered—<p></p> <p></p> ‘Jane, your little feet are bare; lie down and cover yourself with my quilt.’<p></p> <p></p> I did so: she put her arm over me, and I nestled close to her. After a long silence, she resumed, still whispering—<p></p> <p></p> ‘I am very happy, Jane; and when you hear that I am dead, you must be sure and not grieve: there is nothing to grieve about. We all must die one day, and the illness which is re-moving me is not painful; it is gentle and gradual: my mind is at rest. I leave no one to regret me much: I have only a father; and he is lately married, and will not miss me. By dy-ing young, I shall escape great sufferings. I had not qualities or talents to make my way very well in the world: I should have been continually at fault.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘But where are you going to, Helen? Can you see? Do you know?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘I believe; I have faith: I am going to God.’<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	123<p></p>  
‘Where is God? What is God?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘My Maker and yours, who will never destroy what He created. I rely implicitly on His power, and confide wholly in His goodness: I count the hours till that eventful one ar-rives which shall restore me to Him, reveal Him to me.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘You are sure, then, Helen, that there is such a place as heaven, and that our souls can get to it when we die?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘I am sure there is a future state; I believe God is good; I can resign my immortal part to Him without any mis-giving. God is my father; God is my friend: I love Him; I believe He loves me.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘And shall I see you again, Helen, when I die?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘You will come to the same region of happiness: be re-ceived by the same mighty, universal Parent, no doubt, dear Jane.’<p></p> <p></p> Again I questioned, but this time only in thought. ‘Where is that region? Does it exist?’ And I clasped my arms closer round Helen; she seemed dearer to me than ever; I felt as if I could not let her go; I lay with my face hidden on her neck. Presently she said, in the sweetest tone—<p></p> <p></p> ‘How comfortable I am! That last fit of coughing has tired me a little; I feel as if I could sleep: but don’t leave me, Jane; I like to have you near me.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘I’ll stay with you, DEAR Helen: no one shall take me way.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Are you warm, darling?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Yes.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Good-night, Jane.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Good-night, Helen.’<p></p>  
<p></p> 124	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
She kissed me, and I her, and we both soon slumbered. When I awoke it was day: an unusual movement roused<p></p> <p></p> me; I looked up; I was in somebody’s arms; the nurse held me; she was carrying me through the passage back to the dormitory. I was not reprimanded for leaving my bed; peo-ple had something else to think about; no explanation was afforded then to my many questions; but a day or two after-wards I learned that Miss Temple, on returning to her own room at dawn, had found me laid in the little crib; my face against Helen Burns’s shoulder, my arms round her neck. I was asleep, and Helen was—dead.<p></p> <p></p> Her grave is in Brocklebridge churchyard: for fifteen years after her death it was only covered by a grassy mound; but now a grey marble tablet marks the spot, inscribed with her name, and the word ‘Resurgam.’<p></p>  
<p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	125<p></p>  
Chapter X<p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> Hitherto I have recorded in detail the events of my in-significant existence: to the first ten years of my life I have given almost as many Chapters. But this is not to be a regular autobiography. I am only bound to invoke Memory where I know her responses will possess some degree of in-terest; therefore I now pass a space of eight years almost in silence: a few lines only are necessary to keep up the links<p></p> <p></p> of connection.<p></p> <p></p> When the typhus fever had fulfilled its mission of dev-astation at Lowood, it gradually disappeared from thence; but not till its virulence and the number of its victims had drawn public attention on the school. Inquiry was made into the origin of the scourge, and by degrees various facts came out which excited public indignation in a high degree. The unhealthy nature of the site; the quantity and quality of the children’s food; the brackish, fetid water used in its preparation; the pupils’ wretched clothing and accommoda-tions—all these things were discovered, and the discovery produced a result mortifying to Mr. Brocklehurst, but ben-eficial to the institution.<p></p> <p></p> Several wealthy and benevolent individuals in the coun-ty subscribed largely for the erection of a more convenient building in a better situation; new regulations were made; improvements in diet and clothing introduced; the funds<p></p>  
<p></p> 126	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
of the school were intrusted to the management of a com-mittee. Mr. Brocklehurst, who, from his wealth and family connections, could not be overlooked, still retained the post of treasurer; but he was aided in the discharge of his duties by gentlemen of rather more enlarged and sympathising minds: his office of inspector, too, was shared by those who knew how to combine reason with strictness, comfort with economy, compassion with uprightness. The school, thus improved, became in time a truly useful and noble institu-tion. I remained an inmate of its walls, after its regeneration, for eight years: six as pupil, and two as teacher; and in both capacities I bear my testimony to its value and importance.<p></p> <p></p> During these eight years my life was uniform: but not unhappy, because it was not inactive. I had the means of an excellent education placed within my reach; a fondness for some of my studies, and a desire to excel in all, together with a great delight in pleasing my teachers, especially such as I loved, urged me on: I availed myself fully of the advan-tages offered me. In time I rose to be the first girl of the first class; then I was invested with the office of teacher; which I discharged with zeal for two years: but at the end of that time I altered.<p></p> <p></p> Miss Temple, through all changes, had thus far contin-ued superintendent of the seminary: to her instruction I owed the best part of my acquirements; her friendship and society had been my continual solace; she had stood me in the stead of mother, governess, and, latterly, companion. At this period she married, removed with her husband (a cler-gyman, an excellent man, almost worthy of such a wife) to a<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	127<p></p>  
distant county, and consequently was lost to me.<p></p> <p></p> From the day she left I was no longer the same: with her was gone every settled feeling, every association that had made Lowood in some degree a home to me. I had imbibed from her something of her nature and much of her habits: more harmonious thoughts: what seemed better regulated feelings had become the inmates of my mind. I had given in allegiance to duty and order; I was quiet; I believed I was content: to the eyes of others, usually even to my own, I ap-peared a disciplined and subdued character.<p></p> <p></p> But destiny, in the shape of the Rev. Mr. Nasmyth, came between me and Miss Temple: I saw her in her travelling dress step into a post- chaise, shortly after the marriage cer-emony; I watched the chaise mount the hill and disappear beyond its brow; and then retired to my own room, and there spent in solitude the greatest part of the half-holiday granted in honour of the occasion.<p></p> <p></p> I walked about the chamber most of the time. I imag-ined myself only to be regretting my loss, and thinking how to repair it; but when my reflections were concluded, and I looked up and found that the afternoon was gone, and evening far advanced, another discovery dawned on me, namely, that in the interval I had undergone a transform-ing process; that my mind had put off all it had borrowed of Miss Temple—or rather that she had taken with her the se-rene atmosphere I had been breathing in her vicinity—and that now I was left in my natural element, and beginning to feel the stirring of old emotions. It did not seem as if a prop were withdrawn, but rather as if a motive were gone: it<p></p>  
<p></p> 128	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
was not the power to be tranquil which had failed me, but the reason for tranquillity was no more. My world had for some years been in Lowood: my experience had been of its rules and systems; now I remembered that the real world was wide, and that a varied field of hopes and fears, of sen-sations and excitements, awaited those who had courage to go forth into its expanse, to seek real knowledge of life amidst its perils.<p></p> <p></p> I went to my window, opened it, and looked out. There were the two wings of the building; there was the garden; there were the skirts of Lowood; there was the hilly horizon. My eye passed all other objects to rest on those most remote, the blue peaks; it was those I longed to surmount; all within their boundary of rock and heath seemed prison-ground, exile limits. I traced the white road winding round the base of one mountain, and vanishing in a gorge between two; how I longed to follow it farther! I recalled the time when I had travelled that very road in a coach; I remembered de-scending that hill at twilight; an age seemed to have elapsed since the day which brought me first to Lowood, and I had never quitted it since. My vacations had all been spent at school: Mrs. Reed had never sent for me to Gateshead; nei-ther she nor any of her family had ever been to visit me. I had had no communication by letter or message with the outer world: school-rules, school-duties, school-habits and notions, and voices, and faces, and phrases, and costumes, and preferences, and antipathies—such was what I knew of existence. And now I felt that it was not enough; I tired of the routine of eight years in one afternoon. I desired liberty;<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	129<p></p>  
for liberty I gasped; for liberty I uttered a prayer; it seemed scattered on the wind then faintly blowing. I abandoned it and framed a humbler supplication; for change, stimulus: that petition, too, seemed swept off into vague space: ‘Then,’ I cried, half desperate, ‘grant me at least a new servitude!’<p></p> <p></p> Here a bell, ringing the hour of supper, called me down-stairs.<p></p> <p></p> I was not free to resume the interrupted chain of my re-flections till bedtime: even then a teacher who occupied the same room with me kept me from the subject to which I longed to recur, by a prolonged effusion of small talk. How I wished sleep would silence her. It seemed as if, could I but go back to the idea which had last entered my mind as I stood at the window, some inventive suggestion would rise for my relief.<p></p> <p></p> Miss Gryce snored at last; she was a heavy Welshwom-an, and till now her habitual nasal strains had never been regarded by me in any other light than as a nuisance; to-night I hailed the first deep notes with satisfaction; I was debarrassed of interruption; my half- effaced thought in-stantly revived.<p></p> <p></p> ‘A new servitude! There is something in that,’ I solilo-quised (mentally, be it understood; I did not talk aloud), ‘I know there is, because it does not sound too sweet; it is not like such words as Liberty, Excitement, Enjoyment: delight-ful sounds truly; but no more than sounds for me; and so hollow and fleeting that it is mere waste of time to listen to them. But Servitude! That must be matter of fact. Any one may serve: I have served here eight years; now all I want is<p></p>  
<p></p> 130	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
to serve elsewhere. Can I not get so much of my own will? Is not the thing feasible? Yes—yes—the end is not so difficult; if I had only a brain active enough to ferret out the means of attaining it.’<p></p> <p></p> I sat up in bed by way of arousing this said brain: it was a chilly night; I covered my shoulders with a shawl, and then I proceeded TO THINK again with all my might.<p></p> <p></p> ‘What do I want? A new place, in a new house, amongst new faces, under new circumstances: I want this because it is of no use wanting anything better. How do people do to get a new place? They apply to friends, I suppose: I have no friends. There are many others who have no friends, who must look about for themselves and be their own helpers; and what is their resource?’<p></p> <p></p> I could not tell: nothing answered me; I then ordered my brain to find a response, and quickly. It worked and worked faster: I felt the pulses throb in my head and temples; but for nearly an hour it worked in chaos; and no result came of its efforts. Feverish with vain labour, I got up and took a turn in the room; undrew the curtain, noted a star or two, shiv-ered with cold, and again crept to bed.<p></p> <p></p> A kind fairy, in my absence, had surely dropped the re-quired suggestion on my pillow; for as I lay down, it came quietly and naturally to my mind.—‘Those who want situa-tions advertise; you must advertise in the—shire Herald.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘How? I know nothing about advertising.’ Replies rose smooth and prompt now:-<p></p> <p></p> ‘You must enclose the advertisement and the money to pay for it under a cover directed to the editor of the Herald;<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	131<p></p>  
you must put it, the first opportunity you have, into the post at Lowton; answers must be addressed to J.E., at the post-of-fice there; you can go and inquire in about a week after you send your letter, if any are come, and act accordingly.’<p></p> <p></p> This scheme I went over twice, thrice; it was then di-gested in my mind; I had it in a clear practical form: I felt satisfied, and fell asleep.<p></p> <p></p> With earliest day, I was up: I had my advertisement writ-ten, enclosed, and directed before the bell rang to rouse the school; it ran thus:-<p></p> <p></p> ‘A young lady accustomed to tuition’ (had I not been a teacher two years?) ‘is desirous of meeting with a situation in a private family where the children are under fourteen (I thought that as I was barely eighteen, it would not do to undertake the guidance of pupils nearer my own age). She is qualified to teach the usual branches of a good English education, together with French, Drawing, and Music’ (in those days, reader, this now narrow catalogue of accom-plishments, would have been held tolerably comprehensive). ‘Address, J.E., Post-office, Lowton,—shire.’<p></p> <p></p> This document remained locked in my drawer all day: after tea, I asked leave of the new superintendent to go to Lowton, in order to perform some small commissions for myself and one or two of my fellow-teachers; permission was readily granted; I went. It was a walk of two miles, and the evening was wet, but the days were still long; I visited a shop or two, slipped the letter into the post- office, and came back through heavy rain, with streaming garments, but with a relieved heart.<p></p>  
<p></p> 132	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
The succeeding week seemed long: it came to an end at last, however, like all sublunary things, and once more, to-wards the close of a pleasant autumn day, I found myself afoot on the road to Lowton. A picturesque track it was, by the way; lying along the side of the beck and through the sweetest curves of the dale: but that day I thought more of the letters, that might or might not be awaiting me at the little burgh whither I was bound, than of the charms of lea and water.<p></p> <p></p> My ostensible errand on this occasion was to get mea-sured for a pair of shoes; so I discharged that business first, and when it was done, I stepped across the clean and quiet little street from the shoemaker’s to the post-office: it was kept by an old dame, who wore horn spectacles on her nose, and black mittens on her hands.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Are there any letters for J.E.?’ I asked.<p></p> <p></p> She peered at me over her spectacles, and then she opened a drawer and fumbled among its contents for a long time, so long that my hopes began to falter. At last, having held a document before her glasses for nearly five minutes, she presented it across the counter, accompanying the act by another inquisitive and mistrustful glance—it was for J.E.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Is there only one?’ I demanded.<p></p> <p></p> ‘There are no more,’ said she; and I put it in my pocket and turned my face homeward: I could not open it then; rules obliged me to be back by eight, and it was already half-past seven.<p></p> <p></p> Various duties awaited me on my arrival. I had to sit with<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	133<p></p>  
the girls during their hour of study; then it was my turn to read prayers; to see them to bed: afterwards I supped with the other teachers. Even when we finally retired for the night, the inevitable Miss Gryce was still my companion: we had only a short end of candle in our candlestick, and I dreaded lest she should talk till it was all burnt out; fortu-nately, however, the heavy supper she had eaten produced a soporific effect: she was already snoring before I had fin-ished undressing. There still remained an inch of candle: I now took out my letter; the seal was an initial F.; I broke it; the contents were brief.<p></p> <p></p> ‘If J.E., who advertised in the—shire Herald of last Thurs-day, possesses the acquirements mentioned, and if she is in a position to give satisfactory references as to character and competency, a situation can be offered her where there is but one pupil, a little girl, under ten years of age; and where the salary is thirty pounds per annum. J.E. is requested to send references, name, address, and all particulars to the direction:-<p></p> <p></p> ‘Mrs. Fairfax, Thornfield, near Millcote,—shire.’<p></p> <p></p> I examined the document long: the writing was old-fash-ioned and rather uncertain, like that of in elderly lady. This circumstance was satisfactory: a private fear had haunted me, that in thus acting for myself, and by my own guidance, I ran the risk of getting into some scrape; and, above all things, I wished the result of my endeavours to be respect-able, proper, en regle. I now felt that an elderly lady was no bad ingredient in the business I had on hand. Mrs. Fairfax! I saw her in a black gown and widow’s cap; frigid, perhaps,<p></p>  
<p></p> 134	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
but not uncivil: a model of elderly English respectability.<p></p> <p></p> Thornfield! that, doubtless, was the name of her house: a neat orderly spot, I was sure; though I failed in my efforts to conceive a correct plan of the premises. Millcote,— shire; I brushed up my recollections of the map of England, yes, I saw it; both the shire and the town.—shire was seventy miles nearer London than the remote county where I now resided: that was a recommendation to me. I longed to go where there was life and movement: Millcote was a large manufacturing town on the banks of the A-; a busy place enough, doubtless: so much the better; it would be a com-plete change at least. Not that my fancy was much captivated by the idea of long chimneys and clouds of smoke—‘but,’ I argued, ‘Thornfield will, probably, be a good way from the town.’<p></p> <p></p> Here the socket of the candle dropped, and the wick went out.<p></p> <p></p> Next day new steps were to be taken; my plans could no longer be confined to my own breast; I must impart them in order to achieve their success. Having sought and obtained an audience of the superintendent during the noontide rec-reation, I told her I had a prospect of getting a new situation where the salary would be double what I now received (for at Lowood I only got 15 pounds per annum); and requested she would break the matter for me to Mr. Brocklehurst, or some of the committee, and ascertain whether they would permit me to mention them as references. She obligingly consented to act as mediatrix in the matter. The next day she laid the affair before Mr. Brocklehurst, who said that<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	135<p></p>  
Mrs. Reed must be written to, as she was my natural guard-ian. A note was accordingly addressed to that lady, who returned for answer, that ‘I might do as I pleased: she had long relinquished all interference in my affairs.’ This note went the round of the committee, and at last, after what ap-peared to me most tedious delay, formal leave was given me to better my condition if I could; and an assurance added, that as I had always conducted myself well, both as teacher and pupil, at Lowood, a testimonial of character and ca-pacity, signed by the inspectors of that institution, should forthwith be furnished me.<p></p> <p></p> This testimonial I accordingly received in about a month, forwarded a copy of it to Mrs. Fairfax, and got that lady’s reply, stating that she was satisfied, and fixing that day fort-night as the period for my assuming the post of governess in her house.<p></p> <p></p> I now busied myself in preparations: the fortnight passed rapidly. I had not a very large wardrobe, though it was ad-equate to my wants; and the last day sufficed to pack my trunk,—the same I had brought with me eight years ago from Gateshead.<p></p> <p></p> The box was corded, the card nailed on. In half-an-hour the carrier was to call for it to take it to Lowton, whether I myself was to repair at an early hour the next morning to meet the coach. I had brushed my black stuff travelling-dress, prepared my bonnet, gloves, and muff; sought in all my drawers to see that no article was left behind; and now having nothing more to do, I sat down and tried to rest. I could not; though I had been on foot all day, I could not<p></p>  
<p></p> 136	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
now repose an instant; I was too much excited. A phase of my life was closing to-night, a new one opening to-morrow: impossible to slumber in the interval; I must watch fever-ishly while the change was being accomplished.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Miss,’ said a servant who met me in the lobby, where I was wandering like a troubled spirit, ‘a person below wishes to see you.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘The carrier, no doubt,’ I thought, and ran downstairs without inquiry. I was passing the back-parlour or teachers’ sitting-room, the door of which was half open, to go to the kitchen, when some one ran out—<p></p> <p></p> ‘It’s her, I am sure!—I could have told her anywhere!’ cried the individual who stopped my progress and took my hand.<p></p> <p></p> I looked: I saw a woman attired like a well-dressed ser-vant, matronly, yet still young; very good-looking, with black hair and eyes, and lively complexion.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Well, who is it?’ she asked, in a voice and with a smile I half recognised; ‘you’ve not quite forgotten me, I think, Miss Jane?’<p></p> <p></p> In another second I was embracing and kissing her rap-turously: ‘Bessie! Bessie! Bessie!’ that was all I said; whereat she half laughed, half cried, and we both went into the par-lour. By the fire stood a little fellow of three years old, in plaid frock and trousers.<p></p> <p></p> ‘That is my little boy,’ said Bessie directly.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Then you are married, Bessie?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Yes; nearly five years since to Robert Leaven, the coach-man; and I’ve a little girl besides Bobby there, that I’ve<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	137<p></p>  
christened Jane.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘And you don’t live at Gateshead?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘I live at the lodge: the old porter has left.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Well, and how do they all get on? Tell me everything about them, Bessie: but sit down first; and, Bobby, come and sit on my knee, will you?’ but Bobby preferred sidling over to his mother.<p></p> <p></p> ‘You’re not grown so very tall, Miss Jane, nor so very stout,’ continued Mrs. Leaven. ‘I dare say they’ve not kept you too well at school: Miss Reed is the head and shoulders taller than you are; and Miss Georgiana would make two of you in breadth.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Georgiana is handsome, I suppose, Bessie?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Very. She went up to London last winter with her mama, and there everybody admired her, and a young lord fell in love with her: but his relations were against the match; and—what do you think?—he and Miss Georgiana made it up to run away; but they were found out and stopped. It was Miss Reed that found them out: I believe she was envious; and now she and her sister lead a cat and dog life together; they are always quarrelling—‘<p></p> <p></p> ‘Well, and what of John Reed?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Oh, he is not doing so well as his mama could wish. He went to college, and he got—plucked, I think they call it: and then his uncles wanted him to be a barrister, and study the law: but he is such a dissipated young man, they will never make much of him, I think.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘What does he look like?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘He is very tall: some people call him a fine-looking<p></p>  
<p></p> 138	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
young man; but he has such thick lips.’ ‘And Mrs. Reed?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Missis looks stout and well enough in the face, but I think she’s not quite easy in her mind: Mr. John’s conduct does not please herhe spends a deal of money.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Did she send you here, Bessie?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘No, indeed: but I have long wanted to see you, and when I heard that there had been a letter from you, and that you were going to another part of the country, I thought I’d just set of, and get a look at you before you were quite out of my reach.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘I am afraid you are disappointed in me, Bessie.’ I said this laughing: I perceived that Bessie’s glance, though it ex-pressed regard, did in no shape denote admiration.<p></p> <p></p> ‘No, Miss Jane, not exactly: you are genteel enough; you look like a lady, and it is as much as ever I expected of you: you were no beauty as a child.’<p></p> <p></p> I smiled at Bessie’s frank answer: I felt that it was cor-rect, but I confess I was not quite indifferent to its import: at eighteen most people wish to please, and the conviction that they have not an exterior likely to second that desire brings anything but gratification.<p></p> <p></p> ‘I dare say you are clever, though,’ continued Bessie, by way of solace. ‘What can you do? Can you play on the pi-ano?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘A little.’<p></p> <p></p> There was one in the room; Bessie went and opened it, and then asked me to sit down and give her a tune: I played a waltz or two, and she was charmed.<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	139<p></p>  
‘The Miss Reeds could not play as well!’ said she exult-ingly. ‘I always said you would surpass them in learning: and can you draw?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘That is one of my paintings over the chimney-piece.’ It was a landscape in water colours, of which I had made a present to the superintendent, in acknowledgment of her obliging mediation with the committee on my behalf, and which she had framed and glazed.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Well, that is beautiful, Miss Jane! It is as fine a picture as any Miss Reed’s drawing-master could paint, let alone the young ladies themselves, who could not come near it: and have you learnt French?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Yes, Bessie, I can both read it and speak it.’ ‘And you can work on muslin and canvas?’ ‘I can.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Oh, you are quite a lady, Miss Jane! I knew you would be: you will get on whether your relations notice you or not. There was something I wanted to ask you. Have you ever heard anything from your father’s kinsfolk, the Eyres?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Never in my life.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Well, you know Missis always said they were poor and quite despicable: and they may be poor; but I believe they are as much gentry as the Reeds are; for one day, nearly sev-en years ago, a Mr. Eyre came to Gateshead and wanted to see you; Missis said you were it school fifty miles off; he seemed so much disappointed, for he could not stay: he was going on a voyage to a foreign country, and the ship was to sail from London in a day or two. He looked quite a gentle-man, and I believe he was your father’s brother.’<p></p>  
<p></p> 140	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
‘What foreign country was he going to, Bessie?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘An island thousands of miles off, where they make wine—the butler did tell me—‘<p></p> <p></p> ‘Madeira?’ I suggested.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Yes, that is it—that is the very word.’ ‘So he went?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Yes; he did not stay many minutes in the house: Mis-sis was very high with him; she called him afterwards a ‘sneaking tradesman.’ My Robert believes he was a wine-merchant.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Very likely,’ I returned; ‘or perhaps clerk or agent to a wine- merchant.’<p></p> <p></p> Bessie and I conversed about old times an hour longer, and then she was obliged to leave me: I saw her again for a few minutes the next morning at Lowton, while I was waiting for the coach. We parted finally at the door of the Brocklehurst Arms there: each went her separate way; she set off for the brow of Lowood Fell to meet the conveyance which was to take her back to Gateshead, I mounted the ve-hicle which was to bear me to new duties and a new life in the unknown environs of Millcote.<p></p>

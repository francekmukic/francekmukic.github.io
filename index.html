<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>INTRODUCTION<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Adolf Hitler was the Führer and absolute ruler of the German nation from 1933 to 1945. He established a brutal totalitarian regime, endorsing his ideas on elitism and racism, under the ideological banner of Nazism. The hatred that he had for Jews, Communists, Slavs, gypsies and homosexuals resulted in the systematic murder of millions of innocent men, women and children. His insatiable desire for an empire resulted in the Second World War, the costliest war in history, culminating in Germany’s defeat and the re-ordering of world power relationships.<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>THE EARLY YEARS<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>ADOLF HITLER was born at 6.30 p.m. on the evening of April 20, 1889, in the small Austrian village of Braunau Am Inn, just across the border from German Bavaria.<p></p><p></p><p></p>One day Hitler would lead a movement that placed supreme importance on a person’s family tree, making it a matter of great consequence. However, his own family tree was tainted by deformity, mental illness and was incomplete. Not knowing the identity of his paternal grandfather, Hitler would have been unable to produce the certificate of origin that he later required from every German citizen on pain of death.<p></p><p></p><p></p>His life long embarrassment and concern about his own family background, it is thought, led him to obliterate Dollersheim, his father’s birthplace and grandmother burial place, turning it into an army training area. Hitler continually wished to cover up his past, being very paranoid about it.<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p>HITLER’S FATHER<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Hitler’s father, Alois, born in Dollersheim, Austria, was the illegitimate son of Maria Anna Schicklgruber. The father, being unknown, has led to much speculation. He may have been someone from the neighbourhood such as the poor millworker, Johann Georg Hiedler, or indeed the son of a wealthy Jewish family named Frankenberger. Maria had been employed by this family as a cook, before her pregnancy, and it was rumoured she was sent money by the son after Alois’s birth.<p></p><p></p><p></p>When he was five years old his mother married Johann Georg Hiedler. Five years later following her death, Alois went to live on a small farm with his uncle. Young Alois did not like farm life and aged thirteen set out for the city of Vienna, in order to make something of himself. He enlisted in the Austrian civil service becoming a customs officer and rising to the highest possible rank of Senior Assistant Inspector, a huge accomplishment for a man with little formal education.<p></p><p></p><p></p>It was at this time that Alois Schicklgruber, aged 39, decided to change his name, an event that would have implications for the future. This was not due to the stigma of being illegitimate, since it was common in rural Austria, but to appease his proud uncle by continuing with the family name Hiedler. However, the name was misspelt in the record books as Hitler. It is doubtful that thousands of Germans shouting ‘Heil Schicklgruber’ would have resounded as far as ‘Heil Hitler’ in the years to come.<p></p><p></p><p></p>In 1885, after two marriages and numerous affairs, Alois married the pregnant 25 year-old Klara Pölzl, the granddaughter of Uncle Hiedler. A Vatican dispensation had to be obtained firstly as, because of the name change, Klara was technically his niece.<p></p> 
<p></p><p></p>Alois was a strict, traditional minded, authoritarian father and there were<p></p> 
<p></p>many arguments between him and his son, Adolf. Temperamentally he was headstrong, impatient, intolerant and manipulative. Alois died aged 65 from a lung haemorrhage.<p></p> 
<p></p>HITLER AS A CHILD<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>In early childhood young Hitler had been sickly and was spoilt by his adoring mother. According to some, it was suggested that his lifelong addiction to cakes, puddings and sweet things may have developed from his mother’s over-indulgence in feeding him sugary treats at home.<p></p><p></p><p></p>Young Hitler moved home several times when young due to his father’s promotions as a custom officer, most of the time living in Austria close to the German border.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>When he started primary school, aged six, it coincided with his father’s retirement. The Hitlers were then living on a small farm outside of Linz. The Hitler household consisted of Adolf, little brother Edmund, little sister Paula and older half brother Alois and half sister Angela, hunchbacked aunt, Johanna Pölzl and two parents. It was a crowded, noisy and unhappy home. His father, a man used to giving orders and having them obeyed at work, expected this from his children. He was restless in his retirement and spent much of his spare time drinking at the local tavern. The oldest boy Alois, 13, often bore the brunt of his father’s bad temper with his harsh words and occasional beatings. When he left home, never to return, it became Adolf’s turn.<p></p> 
<p></p>He took solace by immersing himself in a fantasy world by reading adventure stories and then re-enacting them. His great favourites were tales of the America West by German writer, Karl May. In trying to emulate the hero ‘Old Shatterhand’ young Hitler said that he did not let out a sound when he was beaten. (He continued to read these books when Führer and ordered his officers to carry May’s books when fighting the Russians.)<p></p><p></p><p></p>Although attending many different schools, Hitler progressed well in the local village schools. However, when attending the technical secondary school in the city of Linz he was socially and academically out of his depth. He fell behind and managed to complete only three years, repeating two of the years twice.<p></p><p></p><p></p>Because of Linz’s proximity to the German border, boys were divided into two fractions throughout the school - one showing loyalty to the Austrian Hapsburg Monarchy, the other to Germany and its Kaiser. Hitler identified with the latter, considering himself to be German. In defiance of the Austrian Monarchy (and his father) Hitler and his young friends liked to use the German greeting ‘Heil’ and sing the German anthem “Deutschland Uber Alles,” instead of the Austrian Imperial anthem. Later Hitler attributed his political awakening to a history teacher, Dr. Leopold Pötsch, who touched Hitler’s imagination with tales of the glory of German figures such as Bismarck and Frederick the Great. Quite early on in Hitler’s life German Nationalism became an obsession.<p></p><p></p><p></p>Hitler left school at 16 without taking the final exam for his diploma. From that time on he would be self-taught, reading numerous books with dreams of becoming an artist.<p></p> 
<p></p>HITLER’S MOTHER<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Klara gave birth to six children. Two boys and a girl died in their infancy. Adolf, her fourth child was born healthy and throughout his early years, because she feared losing him as well, she lavished much care and affection on him. She later had a another son, Edmund, who died from measles at the age of six. Her last child, a girl, Paula, was rumoured to be mentally defective. (The family descending from an isolated peasant society had its share of genetic problems caused from inbreeding. Hitler’s mother had a hunchbacked sister and a first cousin was affected likewise.)<p></p><p></p><p></p>Adolf was always close to his mother and devastated when she died from breast cancer on December 21, 1907, aged 46. He had nursed her up until the end of life helping out with household chores such as cooking and washing the floor. A Dr. Bloch attending his mother later said that he had never seen anyone so overcome with grief as Adolf Hitler at the loss of his mother.<p></p><p></p><p></p>In his successful years, long after her death, Hitler had pictures of her on the walls of the Chancellery in Berlin and in his homes in Berghof and Munich but there were none of his father.<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p>HITLER WITH HIS HALF SISTER ANGELA<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>After eighteen years of hardship caring for her own three children and half-sister Paula, Angela, now widowed, was invited to be Hitler’s housekeeper in 1927. She appeared to bear him no grudge and apparently raised no objection to the relationship between her daughter Geli and Hitler, hoping that they would marry. After the death of Geli, she continued to work as Hitler’s housekeeper until she was sacked in 1935 because of her hostility to Eva Braun. She remarried in 1936 to Professor Martin Hammitzsch, but Hitler claimed he was to busy to attend the wedding. She died in Dresden aged 66 in 1949.<p></p><p></p> 
<p></p>HITLER WITH SISTER PAULA<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>The picture (left) shows Hitler and his sister on a trip on the North Sea, in 1930. She was seven years his junior and they were not close. They had not seen each other for many years since their mother’s death in 1907. Paula, aged eleven, was then cared for by her half-sister Angela and her husband. Hitler did not send money for her upkeep or remain in contact until he settled in a house in Obersalzberg in 1927.<p></p><p></p><p></p>During the war she worked as a clerk in a field hospital in Vienna. Although he supported her with a 250 schillings allowance, he virtually ignored her. On 14 April, 1945, two weeks before his suicide, he arranged for her and his half-sister Angela to be paid 100,000 marks. After Germany’s surrender on 26 May 1945, Paula was arrested and interrogated by allies, then released. She went back to Vienna and worked in an arts and crafts shop. In 1952 she returned to Berchtesgaden to contest Hitler’s will which was made under the name of ‘Wolf’, a pseudonym he had used in the 1920s. She never married and died in 1960, aged 64 still contesting his will. Five months after her death, the court issued a certificate of inheritance under which she was awarded two-thirds of Hitler’s estate.<p></p> 
<p></p>HITLER AS A YOUNG MAN<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>After his mother’s death, Hitler returned to Vienna in 1908 where it was his ambition to study painting at the prestigious Vienna Academy of Fine Arts. Like his father many years before, he arrived in this beautiful old world city, filled with high hopes of success. However, his dream of becoming a great artist were shattered when he failed the entrance exam for the second time. Lacking in education, experience or any useful skills, money and friends, his life gradually spiralled downhill. Hitler became destitute, begging and sleeping on park benches.<p></p><p></p><p></p>The misery of those times, being often cold and hungry had a deep effect on Hitler. He adopted a harsh, survival mentality which left no space for kindness and compassion. It was this attitude, a total lack of empathy, that stayed with him until the end.<p></p><p></p><p></p>“I owe it to that period that I grew hard and am still capable of being hard.” (Mein Kampf)<p></p><p></p><p></p>In February 1910 he moved to a home for poor men, making a meagre living selling paintings of Vienna’s famous landmarks and making posters for shop windows. He read excessively, reading all that was available - local newspapers, political pamphlets, books on German history and mythology, and later the philosophical works of Nietzsche, Hegel, Fichte, and Treitschke, to name a few. He also became increasingly interested in politics attending meetings of local politicians. He greatly admired the noted anti-Semite, Karl Lueger, for his speech making skills and noted the effective use of propaganda to gain popular appeal. These bit and pieces of ideas and philosophies led him to develop a hodgepodge of racist, nationalistic, anti-democratic and anti-semitic attitudes.<p></p><p></p><p></p>At this point Hitler’s anti-Semitism was not outwardly apparent in his personal relationships with Jews. Indeed he did business with Jewish<p></p> 
<p></p>shops owners when selling his paintings and he befriended a Jew, Josef Neumann. However it was in Vienna, a city where the middle classes found it fashionable to be anti-Semitic, that the seeds of hate were sown and would be nurtured by events to come, laying the foundation for one of the world’s greatest tragedies.<p></p><p></p><p></p>He described the transformation as thus:<p></p><p></p><p></p>“Once, as I was strolling through the inner city, I suddenly encountered an apparition in a black caftan and black hair locks. Is this a Jew? was my first thought.” (Hitler lived near an ethnic Jewish community) “For to be sure, they had not looked looked like this in Linz. I observed the man furtively and cautiously, but the longer stared at his foreign face, scrutinising feature for feature, the more my first question assumed a new form; is this a German? (Hitler always saw himself as German as opposed to an Austrian)... the more I saw, the more sharply they became distinguished in my eyes from the rest of humanity... For me this was the time of the greatest spiritual upheaval I have ever had to go through. I had ceased to be a weak-kneed cosmopolitan and become an anti-Semite.” Mein Kampf<p></p><p></p><p></p>To avoid mandatory military service and thereby serving the multicultural Austrian Empire he now despised, Hitler aged 24 left Vienna and moved to Munich. He continued selling his pictures of landmarks until the outbreak of World War One was announced. He immediately volunteered, being happy to fight for the German Fatherland, finding a new sense of belonging and purpose. As a soldier, he distinguished himself for bravery and was awarded the Iron Cross, First Class, a rarity for a foot soldier.<p></p><p></p><p></p>With his soldierly dreams, the humiliating defeat of Germany was had to bear for Hitler. Under the terms of the armistice, the German Army was<p></p> 
<p></p>allowed to remain intact and was not forced to admit defeat. This lead the infamous theory of the “Stab in the Back”, popular with many Germans including Hitler, that they could have fought on to victory, except for being betrayed at home by the ‘Marxists and Jews.’<p></p> 
<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>HITLER THE ARTIST<p></p><p></p><p></p>This water-colour by Hitler from pre-1913, is typical of of his style and shows his great interest in architecture and was of the type that he produced for sale, whilst living in Vienna. Note how little thought which has been given to the drawing of people - they are out of proportion. In 1907 and again in 1908 he failed the entrance examination of the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts. Of the original 113 candidates only 28 were allowed to join the school.<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>THE FIRST WORLD WAR<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>ON AUGUST 2, 1914 a huge, enthusiastic crowd including the jubilant, young Hitler (see detail) gathered in a public plaza in Munich to celebrate the German proclamation of war. Two days afterwards, Hitler eagerly volunteered for the German army, enlisting in a Bavarian regiment.<p></p><p></p><p></p>He wrote later in Mein Kampf:<p></p><p></p><p></p>“For me, as for every German, there now began the greatest and most unforgettable time of my earthly existence. Compared to the events of this gigantic struggle, everything past receded to shallow nothingness.”<p></p><p></p><p></p>‘The Great War’ was a long war involving all the great powers of Europe and eventually most countries of the world. Both sides used new technologies such as planes, tanks, long range artillery, machine guns and deadly gas against each other. A stalemate developed along a line of entrenched fortifications stretching from the North Sea all the way through France to the Saar River in Germany.<p></p> 
<p></p>DEATH OF HEIR TO THRONE<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Heir to the Austrian throne, Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife as they were photographed, moments before their deaths. They were gunned down by a young Serbian terrorist in Sarajavo, on June 28, 1914.<p></p><p></p><p></p>After their deaths, events had escalated quickly as Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany urged Austria to declare war on Serbia, Russia then mobilised against Austria, Germany mobilised against Russia. France and Britain then mobilised against Germany. World War One had begun in earnest.<p></p><p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p>ASSASSINATION<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>The assassin, Serbian nationalist Gavrilo Princip, is hustled away immediately after the attack. His act of terrorism tragically led to the start of war later referred to as the ‘war to end all wars.’ Lasting four long years, from 1914 to 1918, it claimed the lives of millions of young men, wiping out an entire generation, eventually costing the lives of 8 million soldiers.<p></p><p></p><p></p>The bitterness that many Germans felt for their defeat and the terms set out in the Versailles treaty, involving reparations which created economic and political instability were to assist in Hitler’s rise to power.<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p>KAISER WILLIAM II, EMPEROR OF GERMANY<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>The Kaiser had a volatile and restless personality. He was antagonistic toward Britain, the country of his strong-willed mother, Victoria, daughter of Queen Victoria. His less dominant father died shortly after achieving the throne. This meant that Wilhelm was young, inexperienced and poorly prepared to be Emperor when he succeeded his father on June 15, 1888. His desire to rule on his own led him to clashes with Chancellor Otto von Bismarck so that he extended his own authority often relying on the advice of irresponsible military advisors. His foreign policy alarmed all when by trying to enhance German prestige, he expressed a strident nationalism in warlike speeches, backing colonial expansion and the construction of a large naval fleet. He alienated his country from Russia, Britain and France and through his sword-rattling and backing of Austria led Germany into World War One. After Germany’s defeat and the armistice of November 1918, The Kaiser fled to the Netherlands, where he abdicated. He died in exile.<p></p> 
<p></p>HITLER IN THE ARMY<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Adolf Hitler, shown right with drooping moustache, found a home in the army. He proved himself to be a dedicated, courageous soldier, often volunteering for dangerous assignments. His actions led to his recommendation for a medal by his Jewish superior, a fact which was conveniently forgotten by the Nazi propaganda machine. However, he was not promoted beyond the rank of Corporal because his superiors thought he lacked leadership qualities.<p></p><p></p><p></p>In 1916, as Hitler was wounded in the leg during the Battle of the Somme, he was hospitalised in Germany. After his recovery he was assigned to light duties in Munich. Here, he was appalled at the apathy and anti-war sentiment among the German civilians. He blamed the left-wing Marxist groups but mainly the Jews for undermining the war effort, calling them the “invisible foes of the German people.” The idea of anti-war conspiracy involving Jews became an obsession with him. Added on to his former anti-Semitic notions acquired from his time in Vienna, led to ever growing hatred of Jews.<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p>HITLER THE DISPATCH RUNNER<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Corporal Adolf Hitler was a dispatch runner, taking messages back and forth from command staff in the rear to fighting units of the front. On the experience of seeing hundreds of wounded and dying men, he said was “a reminder that life is constantly a cruel struggle.” He claimed that<p></p><p></p>“life has no other object but the preservation of the species. The individual can disappear provided there are other men to replace him.” It was this argument that he later used often to excuse and justify brutality towards individuals and group of individuals. The picture below shows Hitler, marked with an ‘x’, with his comrades.<p></p><p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>HITLER’S RISE TO POWER<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>THE TREATY OF VERSAILLES, signed in 1919, marked the end of the first world war 1914-1918, in which Germany was defeated. The Treaty was hard on Germany. Under its terms Germany alone was forced to accept responsibility for causing the war and had to pay reparations for all the damage. Land was taken away and given to France and Poland. The huge reparation bill caused the inflation of the 1920s.<p></p><p></p><p></p>The picture opposite, taken in 1923, shows bundles of German Deutschmarks (DM) which double as children’s building bricks. The real notes were almost worthless. A loaf of bread cost 1,500,000 DM, so most people abandoned using money and reverted to swapping goods instead. In these conditions Hitler’s ideas began to find an audience.<p></p> 
<p></p>HITLER THE POLITICIAN<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>In September of 1919, (initially working as an undercover agent) Hitler joined a small political faction in Munich called ‘The German Workers Party.’ He soon rose to a position of power, astounding those present at the early meetings with his highly emotional, at times near hysterical manner of speech making.<p></p><p></p><p></p>Hitler attacked the Treaty of Versailles and delivered anti-semitic messages in his speeches, blaming many of Germany’s problems on the Jews. Numbers joining the party grew. Hitler took charge of party propaganda in early 1920 and recruited men he had known in the army. He was aided in his recruiting efforts by a party member, Army Captain Ernst Röhm, who would play a vital role in Hitler’s rise to power.<p></p><p></p><p></p>Hitler not only appealed to the anger and bitterness of the conquered German nation, but with his rhetoric he also returned national pride. He gave them a positive message, promising something for everyone as long as they conformed to the Aryan stereotype and his ideas.<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p>HITLER AND THE SWASTIKA<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Hitler realised missing from the movement was a recognisable symbol or flag. In the summer of 1920 Hitler chose the symbol, one of the most infamous in history, the swastika.<p></p><p></p><p></p>He did not invent it for it was a sign seen in Germany dating back to ancient times. He had seen it every day as a young boy when he attended the Benedictine Monastery School in Lambach. The ancient monastery was decorated with carved stones and woodwork that included several swastikas. They had been put there by the ruling Abbott in the 1800’s as a pun for his name, which sounded like the German word for swastika, Hakenkreuz. It was seen before as an emblem used by anti-Semitic political parties.<p></p><p></p><p></p>By placing the sign inside a white circle on a red background, it provided an instantly powerful, recognisable symbol that helped Hitler’s party to gain popularity. Hitler described this symbolism involved:<p></p><p></p><p></p>“In the red we see the social idea of the movement, in the white the national idea, in the swastika the mission to struggle for the victory of the Aryan man and at the same time the victory of the idea of creative work, which is eternally anti-Semitic and will always be anti-Semitic.”<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p>HITLER FORMS THE NAZI PARTY<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>The German Workers’ party name was changed by Hitler to include the term National Socialist. Thus the full name was the National Socialist German Workers’ party called for short, Nazi.<p></p><p></p><p></p>Through Hitler’s powers of oratory, the party numbers were growing considerably, reaching three thousand members by the end of 1920.<p></p><p></p><p></p>Hitler initially took charge of party propaganda, recruiting new members. The party appealed to the many alienated and disturbed ex-soldiers who disliked the treaty of Versailles and the new democracy.<p></p><p></p><p></p>The picture shows Hitler, Alfred Rosenberg and Friedrich Weber, 4 November 1923, Munich.<p></p> 
<p></p>THE BEER HALL PUTSCH<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>War reparations of 33 billion dollars had the effect of causing ruinous inflation in Germany. The Germans lost their life savings, money had become worthless and hunger riots broke out. It was deemed by Hitler and the Nazis that this was the right time to strike to bring down the government and so a plot was hatched. They would kidnap the leaders of the Bavarian government whilst at a meeting of businessmen at a Beer hall and force them at gun-point to accept Hitler as their new leader. Meanwhile they would win over the German army with the help of the famous General Erich Ludendorff, proclaim a nationwide revolt and thereby bring down the German democratic government in Berlin.<p></p><p></p><p></p>At first things appeared to go well. An emotional Hitler spoke to the supportive crowd:<p></p><p></p><p></p>“I am going to fulfil the vow I made myself five years ago when I was a blind cripple in the military hospital - to know neither rest nor peace until the November criminals had been overthrown, until on the ruins of the wretched Germany of today there should have arisen once more a Germany of power and greatness, of freedom and splendour.”<p></p><p></p><p></p>However the army were not won over so easily and the next day day when the Nazis led by Hitler, Göring and Ludendorff marched into Munich in the hope of taking it over, they were met by a police blockage and were forced to surrender.<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>GENERAL LUDENDORFF<p></p><p></p><p></p>Hitler at the time of the Beer Hall Putsch in 1923 is shown with General Ludendorff who was a German hero of World War I and supported Hitler. This support waned in time. When Hitler became Chancellor, he sent a telegram to President Hindenburg:<p></p><p></p><p></p>“By appointing Hitler Chancellor of the Reich you have handed over our sacred German Fatherland to one of the greatest demagogues of all time. I prophesy to you this evil man will plunge our Reich into the abyss and will inflict immeasurable woe on our nation. Future generations will curse you for this grave action”<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p>HITLER ARRESTED FOR TREASON<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>The trial of Hitler for high treason did not mark the end of his political career as first thought. In fact it marked the beginning. Due to massive press coverage, he became overnight a national and internationally known figure. Hitler used the courtroom as a propaganda platform from which he could speak at length, admitting to the charges that he wanted to overthrow the government because he was a German patriot. The real criminals, were the present government Hitler said “I alone bear the responsibility, but I am not a criminal because of that. I today stand here as a revolutionary, it is as a revolutionary against the revolution. There is no such thing against the traitors of 1918.”<p></p><p></p><p></p>For the first time his views were made known to the German people as a whole and many liked what they heard.<p></p><p></p><p></p>Hitler was sentenced to five years imprisonment at Landsberg Prison. Other Nazi leaders received light sentences. General Ludendorff was even acquitted.<p></p>

Visitors and gifts were allowed. He was exempted from manual work and from prison sports.<p></p><p></p><p></p>In prison he now had plenty of spare time to work on the first volume of his book, Mein Kampf. He dictated this to his private secretary, Rudolf Hess, while pacing up and down his prison cell. The book spoke at length about his youth, early days in the Nazi party, future plans for Germany outlining political and racial ideas in brutally intricate detail. It served as a blueprint for Germany’s future and as a warning to the world that, at the time, was ignored.<p></p>

He had given much thought to the failed Nazi Revolution and now resolved to achieve power playing the democratic rules, by being elected.<p></p>

He spent his days dreaming of the future glory for himself and the party. Referring to the Bavarian style of dress, he said:<p></p><p></p><p></p>“The healthiest clothing, without any doubt, is the leather shorts, shoes and stockings. Having to change into long trousers was always a misery to me. Even with a temperature of ten below zero I used to go about in leather shorts. The feeling of freedom they give you is wonderful. Abandoning my shorts was one the biggest sacrifices I had to make. I only did it for the sake of North Germany.”<p></p>

From left to right are; Heinrich Himmler, Rudolph Hess, Gregor Strasser, Hitler and Captain Franz Pfeffer von Salomon. The rallies became a regular feature of the Nazi regime.<p></p> 
<p></p>HITLER WITH MAGDA AND JOSEPH GOEBBELS<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Joining the Nazi party in 1922, Joseph Goebbels quickly came to Hitler’s attention as he displayed a great talent for speech making, organising and propaganda. He experienced a quick rise in the Nazi hierarchy and later when Hitler came power, became Minister of Enlightenment and Propaganda in 1933. This photograph shows them having lunch in the chancellory garden in 1934.<p></p><p></p><p></p>As propaganda minister he censored everything in the newspaper, on the radio, in books, even art and music to ensure that were in line with Nazi ideology. Being a little man with a deformed foot he did not measure to the physical standards he propagated. Also his wife, Magda, had been brought up in a Jewish household. In the final days of World War 11, the Goebbels joined Hitler in his Berlin bunker. After Hitler’s death, they also committed suicide after first poisoning their six children.<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p>HITLER’S FIRST RALLIES<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>This meeting from 1924 shows how Hitler’s skill in bellicose oratory seemed to strike a cord with his supporters. As early as 1919 he had discovered that effect of his almost hysterical speech making had on the party followers, which he described in Mein Kampf;<p></p><p></p><p></p>“I spoke for thirty minutes, and what before I had simply felt in me, without any way of knowing it, was now proved by reality: I could speak! After thirty minutes the people in the small room were electrified and the enthusiasm was first expressed by the fact that my appeal to speak to the self-sacrifice of those present led to the donation of three hundred marks.”<p></p><p></p><p></p>By 1921 Hitler was speaking to crowds of six thousand and gaining notoriety outside the party for his hysterical attacks on Jews other politicians and Marxists. The party was at this stage ruled by an executive committee who wanted to form an alliance with a group of socialists from Augsburg. Hitler threatened to resign and only agreed to back down unless he was made chairman. Thereafter from July 29 1921, Hitler was for the first time introduced as Führer of the Nazi party.<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p>GELI RAUBAL<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Geli, Hitler’s half niece, was only nineteen when she became his mistress. Hitler said of Geli: “Her cheerful laughter was always a joy to me and her innocent chatter was a pleasure. Even when she sat next to me in silence, doing crossword puzzle, I felt surrounded by good health and well being.”<p></p><p></p><p></p>She supposedly committed suicide in Hitler’s Munich apartment after an argument with him. Her life was becoming increasingly controlled and claustrophobic due to Hitler’s jealousy and possessiveness. Some claim that Hitler murdered her in a drunken rage. Her death appears to have deeply affected him and Göring said that afterwards he was never the same man.<p></p><p></p><p></p>A scandal could have endangered Hitler’s goal of achieving power, so the Nazis made sure that no inquest was held.<p></p> 
<p></p>HITLER IN THE MUNICH BROWN HOUSE<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Politically, the years 1930 and 1931 were good years for Hitler, the Nazis now being the second largest party in Germany. Money was flowing in from supporters such as the rich German industrialists and this was used to pay party salaries and well as helping to fuel the propaganda machine.<p></p><p></p><p></p>This carefully staged photograph was taken in 1931 in the crowed visitors’ room of the Munich Brown House, the Nazi party’s headquarters. The photograph is intended to show Hitler enthrawling his audience with his charisma and showing his personal appeal to the public. When elected into power he frequently reiterated his claim to be the Nation’s spokesman stating in 1936:<p></p><p></p><p></p>“I have come from the people. In the course of fifteen years I have slowly worked my way up from the people, together with this Movement. No-one has set me to be above this people. I have grown from the people, I have remained in the people and to the people I shall return. It is my ambition not to know a single statesman in the world who has a better right than I to say that he is a representative of his people!”<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p>HITLER ELECTIONEERING<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Hitler was a leader of a party that wanted to lawfully overturn the government. It was a see-saw situation: his side went up only when the government’s went down. In 1928 Gustave Stresemann agreed to a plan proposed by the American banker Owen Young for paying off war debts. Spreading payments over thirty years helped recovery in the German economy. With loans mainly from America, things started to go well for Germany until the Wall Street crash of 1929 which led to a world depression. Without foreign trade, production levels fell. Germany had mass unemployment to such a scale that the state’s insurance scheme could not pay unemployment benefits. The country was in a crisis. There was disunity in the political parties in the Reichstag and Hitler knew that he was on the verge of a breakthrough.<p></p><p></p><p></p>The election of September 1930 increased the number of Nazi deputies in the Reichstag dramatically from twelve to 107. The party and its leader were making the headlines in non-Nazi newspapers. Hitler was presenting himself as a selfless idealist interested only in the German people's welfare. Now in the limelight he knew as long as he could continue with this new image, power was just round the corner.<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>1933-39<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>By 1932 many in the German democratic government believed that the Brownshirts were about to take power by force. There were 400,000 storm troopers under the leadership of Chief Ernst Röhm. Hitler, however, knew that to take power he would need the support of the regular German Army and powerful industrialists. Heinrich Bruening, Chancellor of Germany was one of the last men to stand up to Hitler. He invoked article 48 banning the SA and SS all across Germany. Hitler agreed not to ignore the ban, knowing that the republic was on its last legs. An army officer named Schleicher had ambitions of leading Germany himself and asked whether Hitler would agree to support him in a conservative nationalist government. Hitler agreed on the condition that the ban on the SA and SS was lifted. Schleicher had made the mistake of underestimating Hitler, a mistake that was to prove fatal. Bruening had set a dangerous precedent by ruling by decree. With six million unemployed, Bruening was called “The Hunger Chancellor” and his proposal to break up the huge estates of bankrupt aristocrats proved his undoing, as on May 1932 President Hindenburg called for him to resign. Schleicher was now in control and he put an unknown socialite called Franz von Papen as his Chancellor.<p></p><p></p><p></p>Hindenburg liked Papen and encouraged him to take the position. Hitler supported Papen and on June 15 the ban on the SA and SS were lifted. Immediately roaming groups of Nazis attacked anyone they came across but particularly Communists. One fight in Hamburg resulted in 19 people dead and almost 300 wounded. It became known as ‘Bloody Sunday.’ In an effort to calm the situation, Papen invoked Article 48 and proclaimed Marshal Law, bringing Germany closer to authoritarian rule.<p></p> 
<p></p>The election on July 13 gave the Nazis 13,745,000 votes, 37% of the total, making them the largest and most powerful party in Germany.<p></p><p></p><p></p>The SA began massing on Berlin anticipating a take-over, but Hindenburg mindful of the behaviour of the SA would not offer Hitler the job of Chancellor, but only vice-Chancellor. On September 12 the government collapsed and the following election, the Nazis lost two million votes. Gregor Strasser, one of the founding members, abandoned the Nazis and many thought the danger of a Hitler dictatorship was over. But big bankers and industrialists still liked the idea of Hitler taking power. Papen made the mistake of many when he said “We have only hired him.” On 30 January, 1933 Hitler emerged as the the new Chancellor.<p></p>

He was sworn in around noon in the 14 year old German democracy, along with Franz von Papen, the vice-chancellor and many non-Nazis.<p></p><p></p><p></p>The oath taken by Hitler was “I will employ my strength for the welfare of the German people, protect Constitution and laws of the German people, conscientiously discharge the duties imposed on me, and conduct my affairs of office impartially and with justice to everyone.”<p></p> 
<p></p><p></p>Hitler saw this first government as an interim stage to his ultimate goal of<p></p> 
total power. He had said “I am ready to swear six false oaths every day.” He began to consolidate his power.<p></p> 
<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>THE BURNING OF THE REICHSTAG<p></p><p></p><p></p>The Reichstag, The Republic’s daily meeting place, was set alight on February 27, 1933. This was was blamed onto the Communists, but in fact the fire was started by only one rather deranged Communist (probably befriended by the Nazis) and Nazi storm troopers, led by SA leader Karl Ernst, who gained access to the building by an underground tunnel that connected Göring’s residence with the cellar. By spreading false tales of a Communist plot to seize power, the fire provided Hitler with the pretext for outlawing the Communist party and arresting its leaders and thereby considerably increasing his power. However, the real breakthrough was the Reichstag’s passing of the Enabling Act of March 1933, giving Hitler dictatorial powers.<p></p>

Above stand Nazi storm troopers blocking a store’s entrance. The sign they hold reads “Germans, defend yourselves, buy only at German shops!”.<p></p><p></p><p></p>One decree after another eliminated Jews from positions of power in Germany. The Nuremberg Racial Laws of 1935 deprived them of their<p></p> 
<p></p>citizenship.<p></p>

He defends the boycott as a legitimate response to the anti-German “atrocity propaganda” being spread abroad by “international Jewry.” The boycott was unsuccessful but it led to a series of laws in quick succession that robbed Jews of their rights. They were excluded from the civil service, law, journalism and entertainment. It was the beginning of a process which was to lead to the killing of Jews in concentration camps. By 1945 nearly six million European Jews had died as a result of the regime.<p></p>

Going up in flames were books by authors that included Freud, Einstein, Thomas Mann, H.G. Wells and many others. The burning was accompanied by the Nazi salute and Nazi songs and anthems.<p></p><p></p><p></p>The German-Jewish poet, Heinrich Heine, had stated over a hundred years before these very apt words - “Where books are burned, human being are destined to be burned too”.<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p>GREGOR STRASSER<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Gregor Strasser was a socialist before becoming a founding member of the Nazi Party. He was responsible for the popular base of Nazism and of its electoral successes. He broke away from the party because of disagreement with Hitler, resigning in 1932. He is quoted to have said:<p></p><p></p>“Whatever happens, mark what I say. From now on Germany is in the hands of an Austrian, who is a congenital liar (Hitler), a former officer who is a pervert (Röhm), and a clubfoot (Goebbels). And I tell you the last is the worst of them all. This is Satan in human form.” Strasser was murdered in 1934 blood purge ‘The Night of the Long Knives.’<p></p><p></p> 
<p></p>PAUL VON HINDENBURG<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>He served as a Field Marshal in World War one. Because of the early victories he and his chief of staff, Erich Ludendorff, achieved in defending East Prussia, they were entrusted with the supreme German command in 1916. They attempted to break the stalemate on the western front by an unrestricted submarine blockage against Britain. This resulted in the sinking of American ships and then the entry of the United States army into the war with the deployment of many American troops by the middle of 1918 to stop the last great German offensive.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Facing political unrest and starvation at home, ruined economy, mutiny in the navy, defeats on the battlefield and no hope of victory for his armies, Hindenburg called for an armistice.<p></p><p></p><p></p>With the abdication of Kaiser Wilhelm and the collapse of the Hohenzollern Monarchy, Germany became a Republic. In 1925 Hindenburg was elected president as the candidate of the Nationals.<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p>HINDENBURG MEETS HITLER<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Hindenburg was not impressed when first meeting Hitler. He said of Hitler that he might be suited for the post of Postmaster.<p></p><p></p><p></p>Hitler respectfully greets President Hindenburg at Potsdam, March 15 1933, after making a speech honouring the old gentleman and celebrating the union of old Prussian military traditions and the new Nazi Reich. This famous handshake was recorded on film and by press photographers worldwide. It was a brilliant public relations exercise put together with Goebbels, to ease the public’s concern over Hitler and his gangster-like regime and to cover up the plotting behind the President’s back to toss him aside with his elected Reichstag, finally bringing democracy to an end in Germany.<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p>CONCENTRATION CAMPS<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Soon after Hitler came to power, in early 1933, all political opponents were rounded up and sent to the newly constructed concentration camps. One of the first was Dachau, located twelve miles northwest of Munich. Himmler chose an SS man named Theodor Eicke who made Dachau the model for all future concentration camps. The prisoners were never told how long they would be imprisoned.<p></p><p></p><p></p>Rudolf Höss who was the kommandant of Auschwitz explained that in training, Eicke expected his SS guards to develop “a hate, an antipathy towards prisoners which is inconceivable to those outside.”<p></p><p></p><p></p>Prisoners were shot on the spot for refusing to obey any order from an SS man. Routine punishments included forcing a prisoner to stand completely motionless for hours, as shown opposite, beatings and whippings.<p></p><p></p><p></p>Later when more camps opened prisoners were subjected to every conceivable and inconceivable form of experimentation by German doctors before their eventual murder. The ever widening inmates included German criminals, Jews, gypsies, homosexuals and Polish and Russian prisoners and numbered millions.<p></p>

Once in power in Austria, local Jews were persecuted. The picture above shows Austrian Jews being forced to scrub the paving stones watched by Austrian Nazis and locals.<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p>SIR NEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Becoming Prime Minister in May 1937, Chamberlain is best remembered for his failed policy of appeasement towards Nazi Germany. Making three visits to Germany in September 1938 which culminated in the Munich Conference, Chamberlain and the French President, Edouard Daladier, decide to grant Hitler’s demand for Czechoslovakia’s Sudetenland. Hitler in exchange promised that this would be his last territorial request.<p></p><p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p>THE MUNICH AGREEMENT<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Chamberlain returned home from Munich a hero. The outbreak of war averted, he declared that the Munich Agreement was a symbol of the determination of Britain and Germany never to go to war again and that the agreement secured “peace for our time”. However, hopes were dashed the following year when Hitler seized the rest of Czechoslovakia and later invaded Poland. In September 1939 this led Britain and France to issuing a joint declaration war against Germany and so beginning World War II.<p></p><p></p><p></p>In May 1940, Chamberlain was forced to turn over the premiership to Winston Churchill. This was due to loss of confidence in his leadership, when British forces failed to repel the German invasion of Norway in April 1940. He retained his services as Lord President of the Council until ill health forced him to retire. He died later that year.<p></p><p></p> 
<p></p>OCCUPATION OF SUDETENLAND<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Hitler is welcomed as he enters and takes over The Sudetenland at Wildenan in 1938. The Sudetenland was a portion of western Czechoslovakia inhabited by over 3 million Germans. Many of them became Nazis and strongly supported the acquisition by Hitler, claiming to be a persecuted minority. Czechoslovakia was democratic, and its president, Eduard Benes, was prepared to resist Hitler, but Britain and France (their allies) insisted on submission and joined Italy in signing Sudetenland over to Germany at the Munich Conference. An emotional woman, shown below, dutifully salutes Hitler.<p></p><p></p> 
<p></p>THE FOUR POWER CONFERENCE<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>The four power conference between Britain, France, Italy and Germany, shown right, took place in Munich on the 30th September 1938. Hitler had always admired Mussolini and his Fascist regime, who had been in power since 1922.<p></p><p></p><p></p>Hitler is seen talking to Count Ciano, the Italian Foreign Minister on his right. To the left of Hitler is Benito Mussolini and on the far left is Field Marshal Göring.<p></p><p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p>THE DEATH OF HINDENBURG<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Hindenburg’s death on August 2 1934, gave Hitler the opportunity to seize total power in Germany by elevating himself to the position of Führer of the German nation. A nationwide vote was set up to give the German people the chance to vote and express their approval of Hitler’s unprecedented new powers. They overwhelmingly voted with a ‘yes’, and so it was that 38 million Germans willingly allowed Hitler absolute power, beyond that of any previous head of state.<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p>HITLER’S LIFE-STYLE<p></p><p></p><p></p>This image taken from a Nazi propaganda book entitled The Unknown Hitler presented Hitler life-style as simple being a teetotaller, vegetarian and non-smoker. He would not allow people to smoke in his presence. Getting drunk as a young student, and ending up on the roadside the next morning, was his reason for abstaining from alcohol. He became a vegetarian later in his life, in September 1931, shortly after the suicide of Geli. Hitler, deeply depressed at the time, when served ham at breakfast looked at it with disdain and refused to eat it, saying it would be like eating a corpse. From that moment on, he never ate meat.<p></p><p></p><p></p>Once gaining power he began taking a huge quantity of medicines for real and imagined aliments.<p></p><p></p> 
<p></p>THE HITLER YOUTH<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Members of the Hitler Youth perform in the Hour of Commemoration on the steps of Tomaszow Town hall in Poland.<p></p><p></p><p></p>“My program for educating youth is hard. Weakness must be hammered away. In my castles of the Teutonic Order a youth will grow up before which the world will tremble. I want a brutal, domineering, fearless, cruel youth. Youth must be all that. It must bear pain. There must be nothing weak and gentle about it. The free, splendid beast of prey must once again flash from its eyes... That is how I will eradicate thousands of years of human domestication... That is how I will create the New Order.” Adolf Hitler, 1933.<p></p> 
<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>HITLER YOUTH POSTER<p></p> 
<p></p><p></p><p></p>The Poster is entitled ‘Youth Serves the Führer.’ For the young, becoming members of the Hitler Youth movement was not mandatory, but the pressure to join were considerable. By the end of 1933 nearly half of all boys between ten and fourteen had joined the movement.<p></p> 
<p></p>THE BERLIN OLYMPICS<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>It was decided in 1931, two years before the Nazis came to power, to make Berlin the venue for the next Olympic games. Initially Hitler was was uninterested in the idea because of the internationalism of the event. Goebbels changed his mind after convincing him of the propaganda potential.<p></p><p></p><p></p>Hitler saw the 1936 Games as a showcase for the regime and Aryan supremacy. No German Jewish sports-people were allowed to participate in the Games. However Jewish sportsmen and women did compete for other countries, many of them later meeting their fates in Hitler’s death camps. Many countries considered boycotting the event but eventually decided to attend. Hitler ordered while the Games were in progress the removal of the more extreme Anti-Semitic magazine and books.<p></p><p></p><p></p>Many propaganda posters were produced and Lenny Riefenstahls produced her film ‘Olympia’ which was released in 1938.

He and the Nazis knew the importance of capturing the young mind so that their ‘ideals’ would be readily accepted by the new generation. In schools all subjects were taught through the Nazi point of view. Children were taught the Nazi salute and around the schoolrooms hung Nazi flags and the regulation painting of their leader, Hitler.<p></p>

In the 30s performed set pieces in front of the party faithful. He would march up to the auditorium and at first begin hesitantly as if unsure of himself. Gradually he become more animated and building up to an almost hysterical climax, perspiring profusely.<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p>EVA BRAUN<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Eva Braun met Hitler at the studio of his official photographer, Heinrich Hoffmann, where she worked as a photo laboratory assistant. She became Hitler’s ‘mistress’ in 1932 and wife for just a few hours before their joint suicide in the Berlin bunker on 30th April, 1945.<p></p><p></p><p></p>Like many other around him, her loyalty to him never flagged. In an emotional letter written after the July plot to kill Hitler she wrote ‘From our first meeting I swore to follow you anywhere - even unto death-I only live for your love.’<p></p><p></p><p></p>Always conscious of the image he was projecting, in order to appear too busy with public affairs to have time for private ones, Hitler kept her existence hidden. She led an isolated life in the Führer’s Alpine retreat at Berchtesgaden and they were rarely seen in public. The German people knew nothing of her until after the war. Whether their relationship was ever consummated has remained a matter of speculation.<p></p>

In his attempt to impress, a young lady visitor, Hitler stiffened his arm in the Nazi salute saying: “I can hold my arm like that for two solid hours. I never feel tired when my storm troopers and soldiers march past me and I stand at this salute. I never move. My arm is like granite, rigid and unbending. But Göring can’t stand it. He has to drop his hand after half an hour at this salute. He’s flabby. But I am hard.... It’s an amazing feat. Sometimes I marvel at my own power.”<p></p>

HITLER’S UNIFORMS<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Hitler never lost his taste for wearing uniform. During the war years, as can be seen from the newsreels, home movies and photographs, he often wore a peaked military cap and a uniform jacket and riding boots even on occasions when he could have relaxed in civilian clothes.<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p>SPEECH BEFORE THE NAZI REICHSTAG<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Appearing before the Nazi Reichstag (parliament) on the sixth anniversary of his coming to power, Hitler made a speech commemorating that event and also made a public threat against the Jews....<p></p><p></p><p></p>“In the course of my life I have very often been a prophet, and have usually been ridiculed for it. During the time of my struggle for power it was in the first instance only the Jewish race that received my prophecies with laughter when I said that I would one day take over the leadership of the State, and with it that of the whole nation, and that I would then among other things settle the Jewish problem. Their laughter was uproarious, but I think that for some time now they have been laughing on the other side of their face. Today I will once more be a prophet: if the international Jewish financiers in and outside Europe should succeed in plunging the nations once more into a world war, then the result will not be the Bolshevizing of the earth, and thus the victory of Jewry, but the annihilation of the Jewish race in Europe!”<p></p><p></p>A.

Nearly every member from the SA and SS turned out in uniform to celebrate the event. Carrying torches and singing the Horst Wessel song, they were cheered by thousands as they marched through the Brandenburg Gate.<p></p>

AT A RALLY<p></p><p></p>Rallies were an important occasion for the Nazis. They made elaborate use of ritual and the Nazi emblem.<p></p><p></p>Above: Hitler surrounded by Nazi flags at a Nuremberg rally. Right:<p></p><p></p>Hitler makes an address.<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p>RUDOLF HESS<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Whilst a student at Munich University, Rudolf Hess fell under Hitler’s spell, upon hearing him speak in a local beer hall. He joined the Nazi party, becoming its sixteenth member, on July 1, 1920. At the end of his first meeting with Hitler he said he felt “as though overcome by a vision.”<p></p><p></p><p></p>His skills as a formidable fighter helped to hold back disruptions from the Marxists at early party meeting and rallies. In 1923, Hess took part in Hitler’s failed Beer Hall Putsch in which Hitler and the Nazis attempted to seize control of Germany. Hess was arrested and imprisoned along with Hitler at Landsberg Prison. Whilst in prison, Hess took dictation for Hitler’s book Mein Kampf.<p></p><p></p><p></p>Hess served as Hitler’s personal secretary for several years and was later rewarded for his loyal service by being made Deputy Führer in 1933. However, this was a figurehead position with mostly ceremonial duties. In Hitler’s inner circle he was considered rather neurotic by nature and lacking in the ability to use his own initiative. His only desire was to serve the Führer.<p></p><p></p><p></p>Therefore, it was to the Party’s great surprise and embarrassment, when Hess put on a Luftwaffe uniform and flew a German fighter plane to Scotland on May 10, 1941, in an attempt to negotiate a ‘peace’ plan with the British Government. He knew of Hitler’s plan to invade Russia and wanted to prevent Germany fighting a war on two fronts. When captured and interrogated, Hess was not taken seriously. He was imprisoned in Britain for the duration of the war. At Nuremberg he stood trial and was sentenced to life imprisonment, in spite of his obvious mental condition. The Soviets blocked all attempts at early release from his imprisonment at Spandau. In 1987 he committed suicide at the age of 92.<p></p>

<p></p> 
<p></p>ERNST ROHM<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>The aggressive, ambitious, homosexual army officer recruited by Hitler in the early days when the Nazi party was formed in 1921. The stormtroopers (also known as the SA or Brownshirts) were formed from Röhm’s private army. It was through their street brawling and ‘bully boy’ tactics that helped squash Hitler’s political opponents and so they were instrumental to Hitler rise to power in those early years.<p></p><p></p><p></p>After coming into conflict with Hitler over the role of the SA, Röhm went to Bolivia from 1925-1930. He returned to reorganise the SA and became its leader.<p></p><p></p><p></p>However by 1934, the SA had outlived their usefulness to Hitler. In fact with their anti capitalist, anti traditional views and talk of a second revolution and of taking over from the army, Hitler saw them as a threat to his political stability.<p></p> 
<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Their behaviour was causing concern to the big industrial leaders who had helped put Hitler in power. Hitler now feared the strength of the SA militia, now numbering four and a half million, and its leader, Röhm. He was the only man in his career who was capable of opposing him and dealing with him on even terms. Hitler realised Röhm was a dangerous rival.<p></p><p></p><p></p>Hitler hatched a plan with the help of Himmler and Göring to eliminate Röhm and other high ranking SA officers and so reducing their power. In a purge known as the ‘Night of the Long Knives’ Röhm was murdered along with his officers and other political enemies known as the Reich list of Unwanted Persons. It is thought up to 1,000 were killed in one night.<p></p>

The original caption read “Hitler poses for picture on a Pier overlooking beach. He is taking a short rest during a trip to East Prussia.”<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>THE MILITARY BUILD-UP<p></p><p></p><p></p>After his election, Hitler embarked on a massive programme of public works to try and enable Germany recover from the depression. He appointed Schacht as his economics minister, who in the 1920s had brought about Germany’s recovery. In 1936, he appointed Göring as director of the Four Year Plan as the Germans were secretly preparing for war. France and Great Britain, the two major European democracies, fearful of another war, tried to appease Hitler. Overleaf shows Hitler inspecting his navy which had rapidly expanded.<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p>HERMANN GORING (1893-1946)<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Göring was a highly decorated World War 1 pilot. He became a National Socialist in 1922 and took part in the Munich Putsch of 1923. He was elected to the Reichstag in 1928 and gained enormous power before Hitler became Chancellor. He became Hitler’s deputy and in charge of Gestapo, along side Himmler, and the Luftwaffe. He claimed “I have no conscience, Adolf Hitler is my conscience” In November 1938 the German Reich smashed 7500 German businesses and killed 91 Jews in ‘Kristallnacht’ (The Night of the Broken Glass). This was in retaliation for the killing by a young Jew of a member of the German Embassy in Paris. Göring said at a meeting discussing the impact; “I shall close the meeting with these words, German Jewry shall, as a punishment for their abominable crimes, et cetera, have to make a contribution of one million marks. That will work. The swine won’t commit another murder. Incidentally, I would like to say that I would not like to be a Jew in Germany.”<p></p><p></p><p></p>At the outbreak of war when his Luftwaffe was very successful, he confidently stated that “Not a single bomb will fall on Germany. If an enemy plane reaches Germany, my name is not Hermann Göring, you can call me Meier”. His influence with Hitler waned with the failure to beat the British in the Battle of Britain and then against the Soviets. He was captured by the Allies, tried at Nuremburg and sentenced to death, committing suicide with prussic acid, two hours before he was to be hanged.<p></p>

<p></p>Baptised as Roman Catholic, as were all other leading members of the Nazi Party, he and they had little interest in the Church. The picture above was from a book, one of the first of numerous picture books on Hitler put out by Heinrich Hoffman, to widen Hitler’s appeal to the German public. By leaving church the picture was intended to show that Hitler was not a heretic. Hitler used religious terminology when promoting himself and Nazism.<p></p>

The vehicle was supposed to be for the masses, but this was incompatible with Hitler’s military pursuits and so was not put into production on any scale until after the war.<p></p> 
<p></p>HEINRICH HOFFMANN<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Whilst Hitler refused to let anyone photograph him, no photographer could have been more persistent than Heinrich Hoffman. They eventually became friends, Hoffman saying “it was a friendship that had nothing to do with politics of which I knew little and cared less”. Although he did join the party, becoming the 427th member in April 1920. This friendship, someone said, “flashed into being at the contact of two impulsive natures, and was based partly on a mutual devotion to art and partly, perhaps, on the attraction of opposites - the austere teetotal non-smoking Hitler on one hand and the happy-go-lucky, bohemian bon viveur Heinrich Hoffmann on the other.”<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>He made his fortune during the Third Reich as Hitler’s favourite photographer, presenting Hitler as almost a semi-divine figure, the saviour and liberator of the German people. Throughout the thirties, Hoffmann’s publishing company produced books on photographs with such titles as Hitler Conquers the German Heart, Germany’s Awakening, Hitler Builds Greater Germany and Hitler liberates Sudetenland. He died in 1957 aged 66.<p></p>

Apart from Hitler’s financial backers he had became rich from the sales of his autobiography Mein Kampf, which he wrote while in Lansberg prison after the Munich Putsch. He gave Martin Bormann the task of ‘acquiring’ the rest of the mountain. This was achieved by threatening all the local farmers to sell out at ‘a very reasonable price.’ The old farmhouse was torn down and he built this huge new replacement. He used the building for relaxation and receiving foreign dignitaries.<p></p>

<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>THE SECOND WORLD WAR<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>WHEN HITLER’S army marched into Poland, on September 1, 1939, they quickly crushed Polish resistance in a lightening attack known as Blitzkrieg (lightening war).<p></p><p></p><p></p>The pact with the USSR meant that Hitler had to fight the war only on the western front. On the 3 September France and Britain declared war on Germany and the Second World War had begun.<p></p><p></p><p></p>The Polish army fought bravely, but the Soviets also invaded Poland on 17th September. Warsaw was devastated by air and artillery bombardment and Poland surrendered on 27 September. The German troops shown here are seen marching through Warsaw.<p></p><p></p><p></p>The SS quickly rounded up Poland’s large Jewish population and sent them off to be liquidated in concentration camps, beginning the ‘Final Solution of the Jewish Question.’<p></p><p></p><p></p>The speed of the attack, encouraged Hitler to attack Belgium, so by-passing France’s fixed defences of the Maginot Line. The Belgians surrendered on 28 May and France fell soon after.<p></p>

Hitler soon visited Paris with Albert Speer, pictured on the left, on June 23, 1940. Speer was Hitler’s organiser, technological expert and manager of industrial enterprises on a gigantic scale. He was Hitler’s architect of the Third Reich from 1937. Hitler had aspiration to be an architect in his youth and with Speer’s help, Hitler had the means to realise those dreams. Speers designed the Nuremberg stadium and other Nazi monuments but because they were built of sandstone they crumbled within a few years of being built. No doubt Hitler and Speer had ideas on how to redesign Paris at this time.<p></p><p></p><p></p>The picture at the top, shows a Frenchman weeping as German soldiers march into Paris on June 14, 1940, after the Allied armies had been driven back across France.<p></p>

<p></p>ADOLF HITLER AND BENITO MUSSOLINI, MUNICH JUNE 18,1940<p></p><p></p><p></p>Hitler is pleased with himself - the fall of France is imminent and he seemed to be winning the War with ease. During these early months, Mussolini’s Italy was neutral. When France was about to fall, he decided to enter the war on the Hitler’s side, when he was sure that Germany was winning the war.<p></p>

LONDON DURING THE BLITZ<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>In 1941 Hitler used Göring’s overwhelming air superiority to try and defeat Britain. Above: shows one of the many stately old buildings ruined after fire bombs and high explosives fell on the capital for many hours. Right: St Paul's Cathedral remained untouched, despite massive destruction all around.<p></p><p></p>

The V2 rockets were more sophisticated and both the US and USSR after the war used the technology to develop the Space industry. Both were still too late to stop the defeat of the Nazis. Right: British Parliament continued to function through the war.<p></p>

<p></p> 
<p></p>HITLER ATTACKS THE USSR<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Despite all assurances otherwise, Hitler and the Nazis attacked the Soviet Union in June 1941. They initially made spectacular gains and were at the gates of Moscow by the end of the year. By December, 1941, he had also declared war on the United States, the consequences of which he had not truly considered.<p></p><p></p><p></p>Hitler become convinced of his own invincibility. Believing that it would be another speedy conquest, Hitler made no provision for winter clothing for his forces. Consequently, his troops became stuck in the fierce Russian winter and began to retreat in the face of a counter attack.<p></p><p></p><p></p>The Soviets had begun to regroup and began producing more tanks than the slave-labour run Nazi factories. Hitler suffered another set-back, after losing the Battle of Britain when his troops at Stalingrad were defeated in the winter of 42-43 and 90,000 were taken prisoner including his elevated Field Marshal.<p></p> 
<p></p>JEWISH MAN WEARS YELLOW STAR<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>On September 1941 Hitler decreed that all the Jews living in Germany must wear the yellow Star of David and have the word ‘Jew’ sewn on their coats. This policy was extended to occupied areas, including Jewish ghettos.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>YOUNG JEWISH BOYS FROM KOVNO GHETTO, LITHUANIA<p></p><p></p><p></p>Both little boys were later deported to the death camp at Majdanek and murdered.<p></p><p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p>BATTLE OF THE BULGE, DECEMBER 16, 1944<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Taking the Allies by surprise, General von Rundstedt launched a counter-offensive, known as the Battle of the Bulge on December 16, 1944. This heavily armed Nazi soldier, carrying ammunition boxes (left) was a just one from a troop of a quarter million men. With these men and a massive panzer (tank) force, they hit the centre of the Allies lines at the Ardennes area. Within eight days the Germans cut deeply into Allied-held territory. However, the thrust was contained by January 1945 by the Allies air power and Patton and his Third army. This last great German offensive in the West had failed to stop the Allied drive towards Germany.<p></p><p></p> 
<p></p>HITLER’S THREE MAJOR ADVERSARIES<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Churchill, left in the photograph, took over from Chamberlain after his enforced resignation in 1940. Churchill was determined not to appease Hitler after the fall of France. He led Britain in its continued fight against Germany, the result of which was to eventually free Europe from Fascism.<p></p><p></p><p></p>When in 1941 Hitler invaded the USSR, he soon after declared war on the USA, after Hitler’s ally Japan attacked Pearl Harbour. Although the US President Roosevelt, middle, was neutral for the first two years of the war, America had been supplying armaments on a commercial basis to the British. Soviet leader Stalin was forced to take sides with the west, when his non-aggression pact with Hitler became so obviously null and void.<p></p><p></p><p></p>Although Stalin was ideologically at odds with Churchill and Roosevelt, they collaborated to defeat Hitler. They first met in Tehran in 1943 in a four day conference, when they agreed to co-ordinate an invasion plan. They later met in Yalta, shown here, and discussed the post war Europe.<p></p><p></p><p></p>Hitler had the opportunity to meet Churchill in 1932 when he toured Germany but declined at the last moment.<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p>HITLER INSPECTS WAR DAMAGE<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>In the later days of the war, Hitler rarely ventured outside. This was because it was considered bad publicity by Goebbels but also because Hitler was concerned for his own personal safety.<p></p><p></p><p></p>At the start of war the Nazis repeatedly claimed that no bombs would fall on Germany, but by mid-1943, Hitler had to face the reckoning, when Allied bombing was demolishing most German cities. Hitler’s troops were retreating from Russia, North Africa was lost and by June 1944, the allies had landed in France, opening the Second Front.<p></p><p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p>HITLER FACES FINAL DEFEAT<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>As the Allied troops advanced to Berlin for the final push, this local party leader has committed suicide, having first defaced a painting of Hitler.<p></p><p></p><p></p>As early as in 1942, Hitler knew that he could no longer win the war and all that Germany could possibly hope for was a stalemate. However, he still thought that the war could be turned by the development of new military weapons or by a breakdown of the relationships within the Alliance.<p></p><p></p><p></p>In the final days of the war, many of Hitler’s inner circle deserted him. Himmler tried unsuccessfully to negotiate peace with the British and Americans, having offered to surrender his armies in the west to Eisenhower. Meanwhile, Göring sought safety in the mountains of Berchtesgaden.<p></p><p></p><p></p>Hitler was left issuing frantic orders from his bunker. He demanded Berlin to be defended at all costs by armies who were already destroyed or were making a hasty retreat westward, in order to surrender to the Americans.<p></p> 
<p></p>BERLIN, 1945<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>The massive bombardment by allied bombers had reduced much of Berlin to rubble. Hitler was by now isolated and bitter and had retreated to his bunker in January. He had only narrowly escaped an assassination attempt by a group of his own officers on 20 July 1944. Miraculously, he survived the ‘July plot’, but his ear-drums were damaged and he continued to suffer severe headaches from the blast. The German officers responsible for the assassination attempt were put and trial and executed. Hitler had a film made of the whole process, which he watched.<p></p><p></p><p></p>Berlin in spring 1945 was being besieged from all sides and along with many other German cities, subject to massive aerial and ground bombardment.<p></p><p></p> 
<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>THE LAST OFFICIAL PICTURES OF HITLER<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>These photographs were taken March 1945, two months before Germany’s final collapse and Hitler’s suicide. In the grounds of the Chancellery building in Berlin, Hitler is awarding boys of the Hitler youth with the Iron Cross.<p></p><p></p><p></p>Hitler was by now a broken man. He had aged beyond his 56 years, taking many medicines and drugs for real and imagined ailments. Having lost the control of one of his hands and now could only walk a few yards unaided.<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p>HITLER’S DEATH<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>As the allies advanced on Berlin from all sides, Hitler was offered the chance to escape via plane or ship to a neutral country or make a last stand in one of the few remaining Nazi strongholds.<p></p><p></p><p></p>He had always said that he should never be taken prisoner and that he would take a soldier’s death. On 28 April 1945, Mussolini along with his mistress, were captured by Italian partisans and shot then hung from a lamppost. Hitler had always wanted to avoid such a humiliating end.<p></p><p></p><p></p>He married his long-time ‘mistress’ Eva Braun and soon after, on 30 April 1945, they both committed suicide together in Hitler’s private quarters.<p></p><p></p><p></p>News of his death travelled the world and on May 7 1945, the unconditional surrender of Nazi Germany was signed by Admiral Karl Doenitz, Hitler’s chosen successor.<p></p> 
<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>OUTSIDE THE BUNKER<p></p><p></p><p></p>The ‘X’ marks where the remains of Hitler’s body was found after it had been partially cremated. Russian soldiers who were the first to arrive at the bunker, found the remains of Hitler and took these back to Stalin in Russia. These were eventually disposed of in an unmarked grave.<p></p> 
<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>INSIDE THE BUNKER<p></p><p></p><p></p>Hitler’s death was for many years regarded as mysterious because the captured Nazi’s who were in the bunker at the time, gave conflicting accounts as to the manner of his death. This was further complicated by the cooling in relations between the British and American on one side and the Russians on the other. Even the Russians who had found Hitler’s remains were unsure and persisted in integrating those Nazis who had been in the bunker. Several unsubstantiated theories proposed that he had escaped.<p></p><p></p><p></p>Hitler is now thought to have shot himself in the temple with his Walthar PPK on, or by the chair shown, shortly after Eva Braun had commited suicide by taking poison.<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p>THE END OF HITLER’S WAR<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel signing the ratified surrender terms for the German army at Soviet Headquarter in Berlin, May 9th, 1945. Although an unconditional German surrender document had already been signed two days before in France, the Soviets insisted that this second ceremonial signing take place in Soviet-occupied Berlin and recorded for posterity.<p></p><p></p><p></p>He was arrested on 13 May 1945 and was found guilty on all counts at the Nuremberg War Crimes Trial, sentenced to death on 1 October, 1946 and hanged on 16 October 1946, aged 63.<p></p><p></p> 
<p></p>HITLER’S LEGACY<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Many German civilians were unaware of the full nature of the Nazi regime. A German girl is overcome with shock, as she walks past the exhumed bodies of some 800 slave workers murdered by SS guards near Namering. They were laid out by the allies so that local townspeople could confront the work of their Nazi leaders.<p></p> 
<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>BUCHENWALD<p></p><p></p><p></p>It took the fall of the Third Reich for the outside world to discover the full horrors of Hitler’s Nazi Germany’s concentration camps. When the allies arrived, those who had not died, were often so undernourished that their first ‘proper meal’ proved to be their last. The bodies shown on the right were about to be disposed of by the Germans, before the allies arrived.<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p>HESS AT NUREMBURG TRIAL<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>In the courtroom at Nuremburg, Hess, with Göring to the left of the picture, was disorientated, and incoherent. He suffered from amnesia and had general unstable behaviour. But in periods of lucidity he continued to display loyalty to Hitler, ending with this final speech-<p></p><p></p><p></p>“It was granted me for many years to live and work under the greatest son whom my nation has brought forth in the thousand years of its history. Even if I could I would not expunge this period from my existence. I regret nothing. If I were standing once more at the beginning I should act once again as I did then, even if I knew that at the end I should be burnt at the stake.”<p></p>

God sat far off, not as a loving father but as a vengeful<p></p>law-court judge inflicting all sorts of misery on mankind. In the forest<p></p>lurked witches and demons seeking to drag the unwary to destruction.<p></p><p></p>Into such a world threatened by the sword, ruled by fear, and plagued by<p></p>superstition, Martin Luther was born on November 10, 1483, in Eisleben,<p></p>Germany. Within such a world he became a man disdainful of bodily harm,<p></p>convinced of God's love and mercy, endowed with abundant common sense--a<p></p>Christian worthy of study and emulation. Although his station of birth<p></p>was lowly, greatness sought him out, and the whole world has felt the<p></p>impact of his life.<p></p><p></p>The Luther child was baptized in the Church of St. Peter the morning<p></p>after his birth and was named Martin for the saint of the day. His<p></p>parents, Hans and Margarethe Luther, were simple, industrious folk. They<p></p>had moved recently from the farming community of Möhra, home of the<p></p>Luther family, to Eisleben where Hans hoped to make his fortune in the<p></p>copper mines.<p></p><p></p>When Martin was about six months old the family moved to near-by<p></p>Mansfeld. The first years there were hard and it was with difficulty<p></p>that Hans scraped together money to send his son to school. By the time<p></p>Martin was thirteen, however, his father was able to send him to a<p></p>school conducted by the Brothers of the Common Life at Magdeburg. As was<p></p>the custom, he earned his board by singing and begging from door to door<p></p>with one of the school choirs.<p></p><p></p>He stayed in Magdeburg for only a year and then was sent to the parish<p></p>school of St. George in Eisenach. While again earning his keep by<p></p>singing and begging, he became acquainted with Frau Ursula Cotta, a<p></p>woman of culture and refinement, who took the promising young scholar<p></p>into her home.<p></p><p></p>Hans Luther had been working diligently and by the time his son was<p></p>seventeen the family budget permitted his entrance to the University of<p></p>Erfurt. Martin worked diligently too, and at the end of four years had<p></p>passed not only his bachelor's but his master's examinations.<p></p><p></p><p></p>                           Into the Cloister<p></p><p></p>Obedient to his father's wishes, Martin Luther on May 20, 1505, began<p></p>his post-graduate studies at Erfurt, preparatory to entering the field<p></p>of law. But after studying for only a few weeks he suddenly rejected the<p></p>whole idea and applied for admission at the town's Augustinian<p></p>monastery.<p></p><p></p>Hans Luther was terribly angry and Martin's university friends were<p></p>astounded. Why had he taken such a step? Many factors contributed, but<p></p>in the final analysis his decision to become a monk can be summed up in<p></p>the words "religious experience."<p></p><p></p>His parents were God-fearing people whose piety undoubtedly had an early<p></p>influence on him. He shared fear of the horrors of hell, purgatory, and<p></p>the last judgment which was common to people at the close of the middle<p></p>ages. In the university library he had found a complete Bible and was<p></p>tremendously impressed with his own ignorance of its contents. He<p></p>attended church and daily chapel devotions regularly all through school.<p></p>His introspective nature made him starkly aware of his sins and<p></p>shortcomings. Life as a monk was held to be the best way to forgiveness<p></p>and heaven.<p></p><p></p>Several grim incidents increased his anxiety. While on a holiday from<p></p>the university he accidentally severed an artery in his leg with his<p></p>student sword. He almost bled to death and in distress prayed to the<p></p>Virgin Mary for help. The death of a number of students during a plague<p></p>moved him profoundly. While returning to Erfurt, following a visit to<p></p>Mansfeld, he was caught in a heavy thunderstorm and a bolt of lightning<p></p>struck so close that he was knocked to the ground. Overcome by panic he<p></p>invoked St. Anna for aid and vowed "Help me, and I will become a monk."<p></p>Fifteen days later, on July 17, friends accompanied him to the gate of<p></p>the "Black Cloister," monastery of the Order of Augustinian Hermits in<p></p>Erfurt.<p></p><p></p>That this decision came later in life than usually was the case, and<p></p>that his impressionable years had been spent not within the confines of<p></p>a monastery but in the unrestricted atmosphere of a great university,<p></p>later proved valuable to him and to the Protestant Church.<p></p><p></p><p></p>                            Monk and Priest<p></p><p></p>Luther was not received immediately into the monastery but had to remain<p></p>for several months in the monastic hostelry examining himself and being<p></p>examined. In September, 1505, all parties being satisfied, his head was<p></p>shaved and he was invested with the black Augustinian habit and cowl,<p></p>and formally received as a novice.<p></p><p></p>He scrubbed the floors, begged in the streets, and engaged in various<p></p>ascetic and spiritual exercises. When his probationary year was ended<p></p>Luther took the vows of obedience, poverty, and chastity and was<p></p>received into the order of the Augustinian monks. His sincere piety and<p></p>scholarship so impressed his superiors that he was urged to prepare for<p></p>the priesthood, and, on April 4, 1507, was ordained to that office.<p></p><p></p>The petty employments of the monastery did not consume all of Luther's<p></p>energy and he devoted himself strenuously to studying the scholastic<p></p>theology available at that time. However, long hours with books did<p></p>little to ease his mind and give him the peace of conscience he sought<p></p>within the cloister walls. The books taught him to rely on his own<p></p>efforts to procure favor with God, and he was too honest to believe that<p></p>his penitence was deep enough and his fastings worthy enough to<p></p>compensate for his sins.<p></p><p></p>Although his heart was not at rest, Luther continued to perform his<p></p>priestly duties and undertake any new tasks assigned to him. In the fall<p></p>of 1508 he was appointed to the chair of moral philosophy which had been<p></p>entrusted to the Augustinians by the faculty at the newly established<p></p>University of Wittenberg. Desiring to teach theology rather than logic<p></p>and ethics, he availed himself of this opportunity to study for a<p></p>bachelor's degree which would permit him to lecture on certain books of<p></p>the Bible. He had virtually completed his studies when he was called<p></p>back to Erfurt in October, 1509. There he lectured in the monastery for<p></p>about a year, and in November, 1510, was sent in company with another<p></p>monk on a mission to Rome.<p></p><p></p>In the Holy City he visited as many shrines and churches as possible.<p></p>His high opinion of the papal court was lowered by his observations of<p></p>its reckless luxury and scandal, but his confidence in the church<p></p>remained unshaken.<p></p><p></p>    [Illustration: (uncaptioned)]<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>THE PROFESSOR<p></p><p></p><p></p>                               Dr. Luther<p></p><p></p>Luther returned to Erfurt from Rome, and in the summer of 1511 was sent<p></p>as one of three new professors to Wittenberg. Here he came under the<p></p>influence of John von Staupitz, vicar of the Augustinian order, who<p></p>showed warm sympathy and understanding toward the earnest young priest.<p></p><p></p>As yet Luther had been unable to convince himself of God's love, mercy,<p></p>and forgiveness. His quest carried him along the path of good works, but<p></p>he never could feel that he had done enough to save himself. He tried<p></p>the path of confession but concluded there was more wrong with men than<p></p>could be cleansed by enumerating a list of particular offenses.<p></p><p></p>Luther's problems of faith did not mount up through clearly defined<p></p>stages to a sudden soul-free climax. Rather he passed through a series<p></p>of crises. Staupitz did much to comfort him in some of these grave<p></p>periods. He encouraged the zealous monk to trust in the God who loved<p></p>and sent his Son to redeem man, rather than try to appease God through<p></p>his own works.<p></p><p></p>Staupitz' theology was quite different from Luther's. It admitted man's<p></p>weakness and called him to completely submerge himself in God. There was<p></p>no striving, no assertion of self. Eventually the individual found peace<p></p>in a blissful atmosphere surrounded entirely by God. Luther's efforts<p></p>were virtually the opposite. His every act was replete with<p></p>self-assertion directed toward winning merit. He tried the mystical way<p></p>of Staupitz but could never completely lose himself in the essence of a<p></p>God whom he conceived to be an angry judge.<p></p><p></p>Luther's troubled spirit did not lower him in the vicar's estimation<p></p>and, perhaps to get his mind off it, Staupitz advised him to study for a<p></p>doctor's degree and assume the chair of Bible at the university. It was<p></p>good medicine, for thus the distressed monk came to closer grips with<p></p>the source book of his faith. So far, writings about the Bible, rather<p></p>than the book itself, had been his main diet. He studied for the degree<p></p>and preached in the monastery's rickety chapel until October 18-19,<p></p>1512, when he became Martin Luther, doctor of sacred scripture,<p></p>professor of Bible at Wittenberg University.<p></p><p></p><p></p>                             The Awakening<p></p><p></p>Since May, 1512, Luther had been subprior and regent in the school<p></p>connected with the Black Cloister at Wittenberg. In May, 1515, he became<p></p>district vicar for Thuringia and Meissen, having eleven monasteries<p></p>under his care. Meanwhile he was discharging his duties as professor in<p></p>the university.<p></p><p></p>Frequently the solution to great problems comes quite undramatically as<p></p>one goes about the daily tasks. Luther's awakening to a God who makes<p></p>man righteous in order to save him came in such a way. He knew the<p></p>teaching that the righteous shall be saved by faith. But who, he asked<p></p>himself, is righteous?<p></p><p></p>As he studied and taught, and looked after his wards in the monasteries,<p></p>he gradually discovered he had been misled by the medieval concept that<p></p>grace could be earned. This, he found, was contrary to the New<p></p>Testament. Grace can't be earned. God gives it. Man, therefore, does not<p></p>make himself righteous. It is God who makes man righteous. He makes man<p></p>righteous as a free gift (grace) so that he can be saved. Out of this<p></p>came the doctrine of "justification by faith."<p></p><p></p>At this point Luther still felt that he was in total agreement with the<p></p>teachings of the Roman Church. In a humble way he believed that he had<p></p>discovered for himself what always had been--that he had just been slow<p></p>in catching on. Deeper study, however, made it clear to him that there<p></p>was a great difference between his own and the theology of the middle<p></p>ages. He became convinced that man can contribute nothing toward his<p></p>salvation, but that God, recognizing man's unrighteousness, had redeemed<p></p>him and restored him through the sacrifice of his Son, Jesus Christ.<p></p>This indeed was not the work of an implacable judge, but of a loving<p></p>Father.<p></p><p></p>Luther now found himself rejecting most of the medieval writers and<p></p>teachers. He went back to the Bible, to Christ, and the apostles.<p></p>Convinced of the truth, he no longer was restrained by contradictory<p></p>views. His beliefs were contrary to many of the teachings of the church,<p></p>and while he didn't plan it that way they brought him into open revolt.<p></p>The matter of indulgences opened the battle.<p></p><p></p>    [Illustration: (uncaptioned)]<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>COLLISION WITH ROME<p></p><p></p><p></p>                      The Question of Indulgences<p></p><p></p>The Roman Church taught that forgiveness of sins could be secured only<p></p>through the sacrament of penance. This required contrition of heart,<p></p>confession to a priest, and satisfaction by good works. Release from the<p></p>penalty of eternal punishment was guaranteed by the absolution<p></p>pronounced by the priest. If not enough works of penance were done<p></p>before death, however, the remainder had to be atoned for in the<p></p>torments of purgatory for an indefinite period.<p></p><p></p>Gradually a custom developed which permitted one to purchase indulgences<p></p>to offset purgatorial punishment. It was at this point that Luther's<p></p>theology conflicted with the church's practice. Grace was God's gift,<p></p>but indulgences implied that man can earn grace.<p></p><p></p>In 1515 the sale of indulgences was being pressed in the archbishopric<p></p>of Mainz which had been purchased recently by Albert of Brandenburg.<p></p>Because of the vast revenues the office controlled, it was a profitable<p></p>investment to become a bishop in those days. Although not old enough to<p></p>be a bishop, Albert already had procured two other sees before<p></p>negotiating for the purchase of Mainz. Pope Leo X was willing to<p></p>overlook these irregularities in exchange for ten thousand ducats which<p></p>he needed to complete the Church of St. Peter in Rome.<p></p><p></p>Albert borrowed the money from the Fuggers banking concern in Augsburg.<p></p>Then the pope granted him the privilege of selling indulgences so that<p></p>he could settle his account at the bank and at the same time raise<p></p>additional sums for St. Peter's.<p></p><p></p>John Tetzel, a Dominican prior who had displayed shrewd aptitude in<p></p>selling indulgences, conducted the campaign. He didn't enter Luther's<p></p>parish because Frederick the Wise, elector of Saxony, had an indulgence<p></p>traffic of his own in the form of a large collection of relics gathered<p></p>for veneration in the Castle Church, Wittenberg. However, some of<p></p>Luther's people crossed the border and bought indulgences from Tetzel.<p></p>Luther saw the fundamental danger of the traffic when these folk<p></p>countered his preaching on repentance of heart and life by showing him<p></p>indulgences remitting their sins. On October 31 Luther tacked a placard<p></p>on the door of the Castle Church. The sound of his hammer reached to<p></p>Rome.<p></p><p></p><p></p>                         The Ninety-five Theses<p></p><p></p>The theses which Luther posted on the church door were not a declaration<p></p>of revolt. They were, after the custom of the day, an invitation to<p></p>theologians of Wittenberg and vicinity to debate on the indulgence<p></p>situation. So that all participants could be prepared, he posted the<p></p>ninety-five propositions he intended to defend in the debate.<p></p><p></p>The points for argument did not call for abandonment of indulgences but<p></p>merely advocated the elimination of evils in the system. Luther<p></p>maintained, in his theses, that repentance should be a lifelong<p></p>experience and should manifest itself in a continuing effort to overcome<p></p>sinful desires. Indulgences, he said, are simply remissions of penalties<p></p>which the church has imposed. They have no effect on the souls of the<p></p>departed and they don't remit sin; only God can do that.<p></p><p></p>Luther believed he was being a loyal defender of the Roman Church by<p></p>attempting to correct these abuses, and correspondence revealed that he<p></p>thought the pope was unaware of what was going on. To his surprise the<p></p>theses released a great flood of favorable public opinion and were<p></p>applauded as a courageous and unrelenting attack. Within two weeks they<p></p>were distributed in German as well as Latin throughout Germany.<p></p><p></p>There had been a growing dislike of the indulgence system and of the<p></p>pope's interference in what, to the Germans, were strictly their own<p></p>national affairs. The theses now became a rallying point not only for<p></p>those who opposed Rome's continuous exploitation of German finances but<p></p>also for those who resented the dominating attitude of a foreign power.<p></p>Even though they attacked one of his own pet institutions, the Elector<p></p>Frederick stood by his daring young monk.<p></p><p></p>As the Augustinians rallied around Luther, the Dominicans upheld the<p></p>cause of Brother Tetzel. He was granted a doctor's degree largely to<p></p>enable him to publish some theses of his own.<p></p><p></p>When the Tetzel writings came off press and were distributed, students<p></p>at Wittenberg collected a large quantity and held a public bonfire.<p></p>Luther, still a loyal son of the monastic system, was greatly displeased<p></p>by their sophomoric act.<p></p><p></p><p></p>                          Rome Moves to Attack<p></p><p></p>Luther sent a copy of his theses to Albert of Brandenburg who forwarded<p></p>them to Rome where Pope Leo X reportedly brushed the incident off as a<p></p>row between rival monastic orders. Later the Dominicans charged Luther<p></p>with heresy and formal proceedings were begun. On August 7, 1518, Luther<p></p>received notice to appear in Rome for trial within sixty days.<p></p><p></p>By no means a coward, Luther was nonetheless unwilling to be the victim<p></p>of a mock-trial in the territory of the enemy. He asked Elector<p></p>Frederick to have the trial transferred to German soil where he might at<p></p>least have the benefit of impartial judges.<p></p><p></p>On second thought the pope decided not to wait sixty days and ordered<p></p>the elector to arrest Luther at once and turn him over to Cardinal<p></p>Cajetan for delivery in Rome. Although Frederick was not sympathetic to<p></p>heresy he was determined that the man who had brought so much attention<p></p>to his university at Wittenberg should have fair play. He prevailed upon<p></p>the pope to have Cardinal Cajetan give Luther a personal hearing in<p></p>Augsburg where he would be attending a diet or parliament.<p></p><p></p>In a benign manner the cardinal offered to help Luther out of all his<p></p>difficulty if he would simply submit to the pope's authority and retract<p></p>his errors. Luther of course refused and tried to defend his positions.<p></p>A fruitless and oft-times heated controversy ensued and at the end of<p></p>three days Cajetan told Luther to leave his presence and not return<p></p>until he was ready to recant.<p></p><p></p>The cardinal was quite upset by the Augsburg incident and wrote Elector<p></p>Frederick a letter calling upon him to turn the heretical monk over to<p></p>the Roman authorities. Frederick's reply indicated his increasing<p></p>resistance to papal dictatorship. He asked for a free trial and a<p></p>statement of Luther's errors in writing.<p></p><p></p>The pope's chamberlain, Carl von Miltitz, was dispatched to Germany in<p></p>an attempt to rectify Cajetan's blundering. He correctly estimated that<p></p>much of the populace was on Luther's side and the time for forcibly<p></p>suppressing him was past. Resorting to diplomacy he persuaded Luther to<p></p>have his case submitted to a German bishop and to refrain from further<p></p>attack in the meantime. Luther agreed, but only on the condition that<p></p>his opponents would remain silent too.<p></p><p></p>    [Illustration: (uncaptioned)]<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>THE BREACH WIDENS<p></p><p></p><p></p>                         Pushed into the Arena<p></p><p></p>Even while Luther was meeting with Miltitz circumstances were shaping up<p></p>which drove him to break silence. He had stated his willingness to<p></p>recant if someone proved his error. An ambitious professor at the<p></p>University of Ingolstadt, John Eck, with an enviable reputation as a<p></p>disputant, saw in this his opportunity to win renown and also favor with<p></p>Rome.<p></p><p></p>Andrew Carlstadt of the Wittenberg faculty had espoused the cause of<p></p>Luther publicly and had been engaged in an extended debate with Eck<p></p>through the medium of pamphlets. Now a public debate between the two was<p></p>arranged for Leipzig. In preparation Eck drew up a series of twelve<p></p>theses, directed not so much at his differences with Carlstadt as with<p></p>the theology of Luther. The champion of Roman orthodoxy clearly was<p></p>baiting Luther into the arena.<p></p><p></p>After months of wrangling about procedures and proper invitations, and<p></p>with much pomp and pageantry, the debate got under way on June 27, 1519.<p></p>Several hundred Wittenberg students were there--a sixteenth-century sort<p></p>of college cheering section. During the ensuing eighteen days of debate<p></p>they frequently became embroiled with the Leipzig University students<p></p>who sided with Eck. Carlstadt and Eck matched wits for four days over<p></p>the relation between grace and free will. The erudition and cleverness<p></p>of Eck gave him a decided advantage over the Wittenberg scholar, but<p></p>spectator interest was being reserved for July 4 when Luther would take<p></p>the field.<p></p><p></p>For another four days Eck and Luther discussed the divine right of the<p></p>pope with the Ingolstadter insisting that the divine plan of government<p></p>was a monarchy with the pope at its head. Luther agreed that the church<p></p>was a monarchy but that Christ was its head. The passage in St. Matthew<p></p>concerning the rock upon which Christ would build his church was quoted<p></p>by Eck with the interpretation that Peter was the "rock" and since he<p></p>also was the first pope it was clear that papal supremacy had been<p></p>established by Christ.<p></p><p></p>Luther declared the passage should be considered along with Peter's<p></p>previous statement, "Thou art the Christ...." This confession, he said,<p></p>is the "rock" on which Christ built his church.<p></p><p></p><p></p>                           The Shadow of Hus<p></p><p></p>The crisis at Leipzig was reached when Eck backed into a dialectical<p></p>corner and had to resort to foul tactics. How discredit Luther? Perhaps<p></p>if he made him synonymous with heresy....<p></p><p></p>Craftily Eck pointed out the similarity between Luther's arguments and<p></p>those of the Bohemian reformer, John Hus, whom the Council of Constance<p></p>had condemned to the stake a century before. Luther denounced the<p></p>insinuation and declared the Bohemian heresy irrelevant to the debate.<p></p><p></p>It was inevitable in opposing the Roman Church's contention to primacy<p></p>that Luther would use arguments similar to those of previous reformers.<p></p>The condemnation of Hus as a heretic did not necessarily make all of his<p></p>views heretical. In fact, Luther insisted, some of Hus's articles were<p></p>genuinely Christian and evangelical.<p></p><p></p>The spectators and visiting theologians were stunned, and perhaps Luther<p></p>shocked even himself. Clearly his remark would be interpreted to mean<p></p>that the general councils--the highest earthly authority--were not<p></p>beyond fault. This was heresy.<p></p><p></p>Luther had long been aware of the need for reform in the church. As his<p></p>ideas developed it became apparent that the pope was not above human<p></p>weakness. The church militant needed an earthly head, and for the sake<p></p>of good order it was necessary that he be obeyed. But that didn't make<p></p>him infallible. After all, he was human.<p></p><p></p>Now this same reasoning had pushed from Luther's lips the admission that<p></p>councils could err also. Unwittingly Eck had contributed what probably<p></p>was the greatest outcome of the debate--Luther's growing conviction that<p></p>even general councils could be unreliable. Henceforth he would take his<p></p>stand on the unassailable Word of God as revealed in the Scriptures.<p></p><p></p>Results of the debate were weighed by judges at the University of Paris<p></p>who condemned Luther and his views as heretical. When Philip<p></p>Melanchthon, a Wittenberg associate and close friend of Luther,<p></p>questioned the opinion on the basis of Scripture, the Parisians looked<p></p>down their noses at the upstart, informing him they were chief among the<p></p>few to whom interpretation of Scripture could be entrusted.<p></p><p></p><p></p>                        For Such a Time as This<p></p><p></p>Luther was frankly disappointed with the outcome of the debate. He had<p></p>hoped his opinions would be accepted and reformation of the church<p></p>effected.<p></p><p></p>The controversy did much, however, to crystallize his own views: The<p></p>pope did not have absolute authority; a council can err in its<p></p>decisions; the Bible is above popes and councils in authority; the<p></p>Church of Christ is not limited to the Roman fellowship alone but is the<p></p>community of believers throughout the world.<p></p><p></p>Gradually Luther realized these views differed so fundamentally from<p></p>those of Rome that there was small chance of healing the breach. The<p></p>notion that he might become a martyr recurred frequently but it didn't<p></p>cause him to relinquish his zeal. In fact he received inspiration from<p></p>it and kept three presses rolling at full speed to turn out tracts,<p></p>sermons, and commentaries.<p></p><p></p>In addition to the Leipzig debate, the summer of 1519 brought forth<p></p>another event which was significant in Luther's life. Maximilian, the<p></p>Holy Roman Emperor, died in January and the election of a successor was<p></p>of utmost concern to the rulers and populace of Europe. Consequently,<p></p>there was rejoicing in Germany on June 28 when the electors named<p></p>Charles of Spain in preference to Francis of France. Charles was a<p></p>Hapsburg and the Germans confidently expected he would unite them into a<p></p>strong, independent nation. However, the new emperor favored his Spanish<p></p>mother more than his German father and treated his fatherland like an<p></p>outlying province of Spain.<p></p><p></p>Wide distribution of the Ninety-five Theses and other writings, as well<p></p>as prominence resulting from the Leipzig encounter, had fixed the eyes<p></p>of many Germans upon Luther. When Charles failed to step into the role<p></p>of national figure they switched their enthusiasm to Luther. Few<p></p>understood his ideas on Christianity but they believed he could lead<p></p>them to political, intellectual, and economic freedom. Scholars,<p></p>princes, knights, and commoners gathered about the Wittenberg professor<p></p>who had demonstrated his fearlessness in the face of tyranny. Gradually<p></p>Luther sensed his mission as leader in a mighty movement. History called<p></p>it the Reformation.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>                        LUTHER EXPLAINS HIMSELF<p></p><p></p><p></p>                         The Christian Nobility<p></p><p></p>Luther's attempts to interest the pope in reform had proved futile. He<p></p>was likewise unsuccessful in having a general council convened to<p></p>consider his propositions. Now, in the first of three great treatises,<p></p>he called upon the secular rulers to concern themselves with the state<p></p>of the church.<p></p><p></p>Appearing in August, 1520, the "Open Letter to the Christian Nobility of<p></p>the German Nation" flatly attacked corruption among the clergy and<p></p>prodded the laity into doing something about it. Since all Christians<p></p>are priests before God, Luther held it was incumbent upon them and<p></p>particularly upon Christian rulers to feel responsible for the conduct<p></p>of the church within their domains. As Christians they should abhor vice<p></p>and wickedness regardless of whether it flourished on the main street or<p></p>in the monastery.<p></p><p></p>No one, said the open letter, has been able to reform the Romanists<p></p>because they have erected three walls of defense, "_First_, when pressed<p></p>by the temporal power, they have made decrees and said that the temporal<p></p>power has no jurisdiction over them. _Second_, when the attempt is made<p></p>to reprove them out of the Scriptures, they raise the objection that the<p></p>interpretation of the Scriptures belongs to no one except the pope.<p></p>_Third_, if threatened with a council, they answer with the fable that<p></p>no one can call a council but the pope."<p></p><p></p>    [Illustration: (uncaptioned)]<p></p><p></p>Luther demolished the first wall by showing that everyone is equal<p></p>before God. Those holding the title of priest or bishop are not superior<p></p>to other Christians nor do they differ except in vocation, by which also<p></p>a cobbler differs from a blacksmith. The title of "priest" is conferred<p></p>by laymen who themselves are priests in the sight of God. Thus the<p></p>holder of a church title is not beyond the reach of temporal government.<p></p><p></p>He breached the second wall by pointing out that every enlightened<p></p>Christian--layman or priest--has the right to seek God's message for him<p></p>in the Scriptures. The third wall tumbled through Luther's insistence<p></p>that every man, as a priest, shares responsibility for right management<p></p>in the church.<p></p><p></p><p></p>                        The Babylonian Captivity<p></p><p></p>Before his letter to the nobility was off press, Luther was writing his<p></p>second treatise, "The Babylonian Captivity of the Church." The first had<p></p>been primarily for lay people while the second was for theologians. It<p></p>aimed directly at freeing the Christian fellowship in Europe from the<p></p>"captivity" of the Roman sacramental system.<p></p><p></p>The Roman Church taught that it alone could dispense the saving grace<p></p>associated with the sacraments, and that the sacramental acts could be<p></p>performed only by ordained priests. Anyone who denied that the church<p></p>controlled the flow of grace from God was striking Catholicism in its<p></p>most vital spot. Without its sacramental system Rome could no longer<p></p>bind its subjects. This was the front at which Luther aimed his heaviest<p></p>artillery.<p></p><p></p>He reiterated his views on the priesthood of believers. Priests should<p></p>be servants of the people who comprise the church, rather than servants<p></p>of a papal hierarchy. They cannot interfere with grace. It is God's free<p></p>gift to the individual believer.<p></p><p></p>In the course of his treatise Luther also asserted that there are only<p></p>two sacraments--baptism and the Lord's Supper--rather than seven as<p></p>taught in Roman Catholicism. A sacrament, he held, had to be instituted<p></p>by Christ, contain a divine promise of the forgiveness of sins, and make<p></p>use of an earthly element (water, bread, wine). Confirmation,<p></p>ordination, marriage, penance, and extreme unction were rejected as<p></p>sacraments because they lacked some of the prescribed characteristics.<p></p><p></p>The mass had been seen as a repetition of Christ's incarnation and<p></p>crucifixion at the hands of a priest before the altar. By this sacrifice<p></p>man tried to earn grace. Now it became the Lord's Supper--a communion of<p></p>the believing Christian with his Saviour. Both the bread and the wine<p></p>should be received by the communicant, Luther insisted. While Christ is<p></p>really present in the elements, the bread does not become flesh nor the<p></p>wine blood through a magical act called transubstantiation. Moreover,<p></p>Christ is not sacrificed anew whenever the mass is celebrated. His<p></p>sacrifice on the cross was for all time. Through that sacrifice a man's<p></p>sins are remitted if he has faith.<p></p><p></p><p></p>                           Christian Liberty<p></p><p></p>Miltitz, the papal nuncio who previously had failed to reconcile Luther<p></p>and the pope, tried again in October, 1520. He had Luther agree to write<p></p>a letter to Leo X assuring him that there was nothing personal in his<p></p>attacks on the papacy.<p></p><p></p>In the letter, Luther cautioned Leo against listening to those of his<p></p>advisers who would make him a demigod, who put him above councils, who<p></p>make him the final authority in interpreting Scripture, "for through<p></p>them Satan already has made much headway." He also assured Leo that he<p></p>was an obedient servant of the church and that he was not inveighing<p></p>against him personally.<p></p><p></p>Accompanying the letter was a copy of Luther's latest pamphlet, "A<p></p>Treatise on Christian Liberty." It expresses calm Christian reflection<p></p>quite different from the theological conflicts which were carried<p></p>forward in his other treatises. At the outset it poses two propositions<p></p>which seem to be a paradox: "A Christian man is a perfectly free lord of<p></p>all, subject to none," and "A Christian man is a perfectly dutiful<p></p>servant of all, subject to all."<p></p><p></p>The first proposition acknowledges man as a sinner, but one who has been<p></p>liberated and restored to a right relationship with God through<p></p>justifying grace. In justifying man, God has freed him from the<p></p>consequence of his sins because of Christ's atonement.<p></p><p></p>This freedom affects a man's whole life. Not only is he free from the<p></p>consequences of sin, but he is no longer shackled by his own hates,<p></p>passions, and wilful desires. Because this freedom is based on his own<p></p>personal relationship with God, no one can interfere. He is "subject to<p></p>none."<p></p><p></p>The second proposition indicates that the free man's life takes a<p></p>different direction. Originally he was concerned with himself, but now<p></p>the reborn person, in gratitude for his own freedom, serves his<p></p>neighbor. His motive is not merely humanitarian, but stems out of a<p></p>sincere desire to help others become free too. Love permits him to do no<p></p>less than become the servant of all.<p></p><p></p>The treatise and letter would have scant effect on Pope Leo. Five months<p></p>previously he had signed a bull excommunicating Luther.<p></p><p></p><p></p>                             The Papal Bull<p></p><p></p>A chronological listing of events can be misleading--for instance those<p></p>concerning the papal bull. It was signed by Leo on June 15, 1520. It<p></p>reached Luther officially on October 10. He immediately wrote a fiery<p></p>epistle denouncing it and Eck, whose style and invective he recognized.<p></p>Aware that the bull was being circulated and that his literature was<p></p>being burned, he nevertheless sat down in November and wrote a friendly<p></p>letter to the pope accompanying it with his treatise on Christian<p></p>liberty.<p></p><p></p>On the surface this would indicate insincerity, but events shaped up to<p></p>prove he was being consistent. Although he knew he had personal enemies,<p></p>he never lost sight of the fact that he was fighting a system rather<p></p>than individuals. The pope, for him, was merely a figurehead, in this<p></p>instance the symbol of an intolerable autocracy in an area where<p></p>individual freedom before God was essential.<p></p><p></p>The papal bull credited Luther with forty-one errors, called for the<p></p>burning of his books, charged heresy, gave him sixty days to submit, and<p></p>warned everyone against sheltering him in his excommunication.<p></p>Distribution of the bull was in the hands of Eck and papal legate Jerome<p></p>Aleander. They succeeded in posting copies of the bull and burning books<p></p>in several cities, but largely their efforts were unsuccessful due to<p></p>strenuous opposition by the German people.<p></p><p></p>On December 10, probably in reprisal for a book-burning at Cologne,<p></p>Melanchthon posted a notice on the Wittenberg University bulletin board<p></p>inviting students and faculty to a bonfire outside the Elster gate of<p></p>the city. Books on scholastic theology, and especially those works of<p></p>canon law on which the pope and the Roman hierarchy based their claims<p></p>to power, were tossed into the flames. Then Luther stepped forward<p></p>quietly and with a prayer on his lips added the booklet containing the<p></p>papal bull to the fire. He and the professors withdrew but the students<p></p>made a holiday of the affair, parading and singing throughout the town<p></p>and burning books of Luther's opponents.<p></p><p></p>Significantly, the bonfire marked the end of the sixty-day period of<p></p>grace. From now on no one was to communicate with Luther or provide him<p></p>with the necessities of life. In the eyes of Rome he was an outlaw.<p></p><p></p>    [Illustration: (uncaptioned)]<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>THE MONK STANDS FIRM<p></p><p></p><p></p>                           The Diet of Worms<p></p><p></p>Overtones of intrigue and statecraft are dominant in the prelude to the<p></p>imperial assembly at Worms. The church at Rome had given its decision.<p></p>Would the secular authorities now take action and turn him over to the<p></p>papal authorities?<p></p><p></p>Charles, at his coronation as emperor, had subscribed to the imperial<p></p>constitution which said no German should be taken outside his country<p></p>for trial, and also that no one should be outlawed without a hearing.<p></p>Frederick the Wise, Luther's elector, took no action against him, using<p></p>these same reasons as an excuse. Aleander, the papal representative,<p></p>wanted the case settled arbitrarily by the emperor since he was well<p></p>aware of the support Luther would receive at a public hearing. The man<p></p>had been condemned by the church, he argued, and as good churchmen the<p></p>rulers should simply apprehend the Wittenberg monk without a further<p></p>examination of his views.<p></p><p></p>For the first three months of 1521 the diet devoted itself chiefly to<p></p>transacting state business. During this period Emperor Charles changed<p></p>his mind several times about inviting the Wittenberg monk for a hearing.<p></p>Finally, on March 6, against his will, he offered Luther a safe-conduct<p></p>to Worms.<p></p><p></p>In a two-wheeled cart Luther and a few companions set out from<p></p>Wittenberg on April 2. Cities along the way welcomed him and invited him<p></p>to preach, but no reception equaled the one on his arrival at Worms.<p></p>When the party was sighted from the cathedral tower at 10 A. M., on<p></p>April 16, a group of horsemen dashed out to act as an escort through the<p></p>city gate. Two thousand spectators thronged the streets so that Luther<p></p>was barely able to reach his lodging in the house of the Knights of St.<p></p>John.<p></p><p></p>He was summoned to appear at four o'clock the following afternoon, and<p></p>because of the crowds in the streets was conducted through gardens and<p></p>alleys to the episcopal palace where the diet was meeting. When the door<p></p>of the assembly hall was opened, Luther was ushered through a company of<p></p>princes, nobles, and ecclesiastics to the foot of a canopied chair. On<p></p>it sat Charles, the twenty-one-year-old emperor. Near by was a table<p></p>loaded with books.<p></p><p></p><p></p>                          Answer Without Horns<p></p><p></p>After the opening courtesies had been dispatched the presiding officer,<p></p>an official of the archbishop of Trier, pointed to the books, asked<p></p>Luther if he was the author, and if he was ready to retract what he had<p></p>written.<p></p><p></p>Luther had been instructed to speak only in answer to direct questions<p></p>and was not to seek a discussion. However, this double question could<p></p>not be answered yes or no. He paused and his legal adviser asked that<p></p>the titles be read. Luther then acknowledged that the books were his.<p></p><p></p>Again the question, "Will you retract...?"<p></p><p></p>The monk believed his writing was an accurate interpretation of God's<p></p>Word. In his mind was Christ's admonition to the disciples "whosoever<p></p>shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father...."<p></p>Since salvation was involved he asked time to think over the answer. The<p></p>diet agreed that he should return at four the next afternoon.<p></p><p></p>After a night of prayer Luther again appeared before the impressive<p></p>assembly. This time a larger hall had been chosen because of the<p></p>tremendous crowd. Again the formalities, and again the question, but<p></p>this time phrased a bit differently. "Do you defend all of your books or<p></p>are you willing to recall some things?" This was the opening Luther had<p></p>been seeking and he quickly shaped his strategy to take advantage of it.<p></p>They were forcing him to make a speech since a categorical answer was<p></p>impossible.<p></p><p></p>The books were in three classes, Luther explained. The first was purely<p></p>devotional and had been commended even by his enemies. The second was<p></p>against the papacy. If he recanted these he would open the door to<p></p>further tyranny and impiety. The third class inveighed against<p></p>individuals, and in these he admitted he had used caustic and<p></p>intemperate language. Still the facts had to stand unless refuted by the<p></p>Scriptures, in which case he would be first to cast his books into the<p></p>fires.<p></p><p></p>Obviously the diet could not at this moment disprove his works by the<p></p>Bible. There was a consultation. The interrogator turned to Luther.<p></p>"Give us a direct answer--one without horns. Will you or will you not<p></p>recant your errors?"<p></p><p></p><p></p>                         Neither Right nor Safe<p></p><p></p>The Spanish guards were mentally stacking faggots around the lonely<p></p>little figure in the middle of the room. Princes, nobles, and the Holy<p></p>Roman Emperor leaned forward to catch his words.<p></p><p></p>"Since Your Majesty and Your Lordships want a direct reply, I will<p></p>answer without horns or teeth," he began quietly.<p></p><p></p>The spectators looked at each other significantly, then back to the<p></p>earnest friar. Confidence was returning and his voice carried plainly to<p></p>all corners of the room.<p></p><p></p>"Unless convinced by the testimony of Scripture or right reason--for I<p></p>trust neither the pope nor councils inasmuch as they have often erred<p></p>and contradicted one another--I am bound in conscience, held captive by<p></p>the Word of God in the Scriptures I have quoted. I neither can nor will<p></p>recant anything, for it is neither right nor safe to act against<p></p>conscience. God help me! Amen."<p></p><p></p>There was silence for an instant. Then pandemonium broke loose. The<p></p>interrogator tried to restore order but the emperor walked out and the<p></p>meeting adjourned. Luther was escorted back to his rooms by the admiring<p></p>populace. Nobles who had been on the fringe now openly praised the<p></p>courageous preacher and vowed their support. During the night warning<p></p>notices were surreptitiously posted on the doors of his enemies.<p></p><p></p>Charles summoned the electors and princes the following day to decide<p></p>what should be done. His own impulse to condemn Luther right away was<p></p>restrained because he needed the good will of the Germans in other<p></p>measures coming before the diet. A plan was evolved whereby a select<p></p>group of theologians would call on Luther and try to effect a<p></p>reconciliation through persuasion. The discussion always bogged down<p></p>when Luther insisted he must be persuaded on the basis of Scripture.<p></p><p></p>Having received a twenty-one-day safe-conduct Luther set out for<p></p>Wittenberg on April 26. The diet closed officially on May 25, and the<p></p>next day, following a rump session of prejudiced nobles, the emperor<p></p>signed the Edict of Worms. According to it, Luther was the devil himself<p></p>in a monk's habit. He was to be seized on sight and turned over to the<p></p>emperor--an outlaw of the church and the state.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>                            DRASTIC CHANGES<p></p><p></p><p></p>                         Wartburg to Wittenberg<p></p><p></p>Fortunately for Luther there was more than noisy adulation among the<p></p>people. A few sober minds knew how relentless the papal wolves would be<p></p>in tracking him down after the safe-conduct expired, and so a<p></p>"kidnapping" and removal to a safe place was planned.<p></p><p></p>Luther made a detour along the road to Wittenberg in order to visit<p></p>relatives at Möhra. For months the outside world knew only that he had<p></p>been captured near there in the Thuringian forest by a band of knights.<p></p>Many lamented him as dead, but gradually the flow of thorny letters to<p></p>his adversaries and the new treatises rolling from the press allayed<p></p>their fears.<p></p><p></p>By a circuitous route Luther had been conveyed to the Wartburg, an<p></p>ancient fortress-castle near Eisenach. He arrived on May 4 and, with the<p></p>exception of short trips into the forest and to near-by villages, did<p></p>not leave for seven months. To outward appearances he was Junker George,<p></p>a carefree, bearded knight with sword swinging impressively at his side.<p></p>The secret was well kept and at the outset even the elector, who<p></p>authorized the masquerade, did not know Luther's whereabouts.<p></p><p></p>Luther chafed at his forced inactivity, and, ever the monk, fell to<p></p>contemplation and examination of himself. Could past generations and<p></p>earlier scholars have been so completely out of step with the gospel?<p></p>Could a mere friar be right against them all? Might he not be in error<p></p>and drag many others to eternal damnation?<p></p><p></p>    [Illustration: (uncaptioned)]<p></p><p></p>Hard work helped take his mind off his problems. During his stay in the<p></p>Wartburg, in addition to correspondence and pamphlets, he authored a<p></p>work on confession, expositions on several Psalms, a commentary on the<p></p>Magnificat, had a volume of sermons on the Epistles and Gospels well<p></p>underway, and had translated the entire New Testament into German.<p></p><p></p>Prayer and study restored his conviction. To doubt, or even to remain<p></p>silent was like going against conscience--neither right nor safe. With<p></p>conviction came a sense of divine commission. When events called him<p></p>back into the world again he went courageously and with determination.<p></p>He was a revolutionary, but a conservative one. That quality is what<p></p>took him back to Wittenberg.<p></p><p></p><p></p>                        From Freedom to License<p></p><p></p>So often a new movement suffers from overenthusiasm. The Reformation was<p></p>no exception in this respect. Zealots took the usual shortcut from<p></p>bondage to freedom by way of turmoil instead of restrained orderly<p></p>procedure.<p></p><p></p>In parts of Germany the old ways were thrown off hastily. Organs,<p></p>paintings, and statues were thrown from the churches, vestments were<p></p>discarded, bread and wine were both administered to the laity, priests<p></p>married, nuns took husbands, monastic vows were renounced, various forms<p></p>of the mass were discontinued, priests and worshipers who persisted in<p></p>the traditional forms were attacked.<p></p><p></p>Rumors of violent acts reached the Wartburg. Luther, still in the guise<p></p>of Junker George, made a hurried trip to Wittenberg early in December,<p></p>1521. Matters there had not yet reached the unrestrained stage which<p></p>they later assumed. Nevertheless he cautioned the people in a "warning<p></p>against riot and rebellion," written on his return to the Wartburg.<p></p><p></p>In it he reasoned that reform is not so much a matter of externals as of<p></p>faith. Breaking up the furniture in a church does not change the heart<p></p>of a man. Vandalism is by no means a sign of repentance and trust in<p></p>God--in fact it approaches the old form of seeking favor through works.<p></p>Giving wine as well as bread in the Lord's Supper is not as important as<p></p>the spiritual attitude of the communicant.<p></p><p></p>Finally the tumult in Wittenberg reached the point where he had to step<p></p>in, so--in the face of the imperial ban--he returned on March 6, 1522.<p></p>Insisting that no drastic change should be made until, through<p></p>re-education, those affected requested it as a matter of faith, he<p></p>restored order in the university city in a remarkably short time.<p></p><p></p>The peasants meanwhile took the shortcut to freedom, too, in a series of<p></p>bloody uprisings. Chafing under their bondage to the nobles, they<p></p>adapted Luther's "free lord of all" statement to their own demands for<p></p>social reform. Luther preached the Christian duty of submission to<p></p>lawful authority, but the peasants ravaged and plundered until finally<p></p>defeated in 1525. It was a dark hour in the Reformation.<p></p><p></p><p></p>                         Pigtails on the Pillow<p></p><p></p>Wittenberg, June 14--Katherine von Bora, 26, late of the Cistercian<p></p>nunnery at Nimbschen, and Martin Luther, 42, professor of Bible at the<p></p>local university, were married last night at a simple ceremony in the<p></p>Black Cloister. Dr. John Bugenhagen officiated. In attendance were<p></p>Artist Lucas Cranach and Mrs. Cranach; Dr. Justus Jonas, prior of Castle<p></p>Church; and John Apel, professor of law at the university....<p></p><p></p>If there had been newspapers in 1525, Luther's wedding might have been<p></p>announced to the public in this way. However, newspapers weren't to<p></p>appear until much later, and the lack of publicity gave gossips and<p></p>slanderers choice opportunity to vilify the former monk and nun. The<p></p>malicious stories were partly offset by a public ceremony, complete with<p></p>a special service in the town church, a wedding dinner in the cloister,<p></p>and a dance at the town hall on June 27.<p></p><p></p>The wedding was a direct result of Luther's reform teachings. He<p></p>disliked the monastic system because men and women sought merit before<p></p>God through restraints and vows rather than depending upon grace.<p></p>Celibacy, he had written earlier, is not founded on Scripture but<p></p>marriage is. These teachings found their way into many cloisters and<p></p>convents, among them the one at Nimbschen where Katherine von Bora, at<p></p>the age of sixteen, had been received into the Cistercian Order.<p></p><p></p>She and eleven other nuns sought Luther's assistance in effecting a plan<p></p>of escape. Although he had no idea of what it would involve for him<p></p>personally, he arranged for them to be smuggled out of the convent in<p></p>empty fish barrels on the day before Easter in 1523. The plan succeeded<p></p>and some of the nuns came to Wittenberg where they found homes,<p></p>husbands, or new positions. Two years later Kathie was the only one not<p></p>permanently cared for despite Luther's several attempts at matchmaking.<p></p>Then the spunky miss hinted rather boldly that the Reformer himself<p></p>would be an acceptable husband and he resolved to take the course which<p></p>he had urged on so many others.<p></p><p></p>It was strange for one accustomed to solitude. "Formerly at the table I<p></p>was alone," he wrote, "now I am with someone. When I awaken I see a pair<p></p>of pigtails on the pillow which were not there before."<p></p><p></p><p></p>                      The Cloister Becomes a Home<p></p><p></p>Marriage probably extended Luther's life for a number of years.<p></p>Previously he and his dog enjoyed an irregular sort of existence in the<p></p>Black Cloister. Dishes were covered with dust, the bed hadn't been made<p></p>in over a year, his clothes were in disorder. Sometimes Luther forgot<p></p>his meals altogether and at other times stuffed himself.<p></p><p></p>The vigor with which his industrious wife established order can be<p></p>imagined by his reference to her as "my lord Kathie." She was an<p></p>efficient housekeeper and thrifty manager of what little they possessed<p></p>at the outset. Neither had any money. Luther refused pay for his<p></p>writing, although the publishers grew rich, nor did he receive any tax<p></p>revenues from the cloister since he had laid aside his cowl.<p></p><p></p>Things improved when the elector gave Luther the cloister for a home,<p></p>and adjacent to it a vegetable garden with a small brew house where<p></p>Kathie prepared the family beverage. His small salary as professor was<p></p>augmented somewhat when they took in boarding students attending the<p></p>university.<p></p><p></p>The Luthers had six children. Two of them died in childhood, but<p></p>otherwise the family enjoyed a merry, wholesome life. The house was<p></p>always full of visitors--some of them more or less permanent--including<p></p>traveling dignitaries, numerous aunts and relatives, monks and nuns<p></p>seeking a permanent residence, and four orphaned children from among<p></p>their kinsfolk. Because it was large and suitable, the cloister<p></p>sometimes was used as a hospital, and it was not unusual for the<p></p>"family" to number as many as twenty-five. Guests who stayed for any<p></p>length of time were expected to take part in household duties,<p></p>participate in daily prayers, catechetical study, and family devotions.<p></p>Music, singing, chess, and outdoor bowling were forms of recreation.<p></p>Through Kathie's economy, improvements were made in the Luther house. An<p></p>orchard, hop garden, and finally a farm were purchased.<p></p><p></p>When Luther worried about his children's future he overcame it with<p></p>faith. A pious training is most important, he wrote. It is good to leave<p></p>an inheritance, but preparing children to manage wisely is more<p></p>important. We parents are fools if we don't train them to fear God, to<p></p>control themselves, and to live honorably.<p></p><p></p>    [Illustration: (uncaptioned)]<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>A CHURCH REBORN<p></p><p></p><p></p>                        The National Conscience<p></p><p></p>The people at Wittenberg and in other cities of influence were gradually<p></p>learning to think of the church as separate from the Roman hierarchy.<p></p>Now there was need for reorganization. A steady supply of ministers was<p></p>essential and arrangements had to be made for their training and<p></p>support. A bond of some sort was necessary to establish unity of<p></p>endeavor, and mission work was imperative in areas where conviction had<p></p>lapsed into indifference.<p></p><p></p>Luther didn't care for organizational work. The thought that the new<p></p>church might degenerate into a system of laws and regulations haunted<p></p>him. Although his revised order of worship was finding its way into use<p></p>he felt that still more urgent matters demanded attention. Proper<p></p>instruction of young and old was essential and to accomplish it there<p></p>had to be some sort of oversight.<p></p><p></p>The bishops had neglected instruction of the laymen and the princes were<p></p>loath to reinstitute it. Luther, therefore, laid the task directly upon<p></p>the congregations and in some cases the city councils to select<p></p>competent men as pastors, establish pastoral districts, and set up<p></p>schools. To advise and assist in this work, visitation committees<p></p>comprising learned laymen and theologians traveled throughout Saxony<p></p>beginning in 1527. The visitation was carried on in other areas of<p></p>Germany too, and in this way the groundwork for future organization<p></p>began.<p></p><p></p>In the meantime two distinct factions had developed among the princes of<p></p>Germany. One espoused the Roman cause, the other the Reformation. From<p></p>1525 to 1529 a series of diets and assemblies was held. The rival<p></p>princes concerned themselves largely with attempts at, and opposition<p></p>to, the invoking of the ban against Luther, his works, and his cohorts<p></p>which had been executed at Worms. At Speyer in 1529 the Catholic<p></p>princes, with the emperor's backing, tried to force a resolution<p></p>preventing the spread of Luther's teachings in any new areas, but the<p></p>Reformation princes protested. Matters concerning salvation were of an<p></p>individual nature and could not be legislated. Conscience bound them to<p></p>oppose the resolution. Principles which the Wittenberg monk had declared<p></p>only eight years before were becoming the national mind.<p></p><p></p><p></p>                        The Augsburg Confession<p></p><p></p>Sparks of the Reformation had caught fire elsewhere in Europe developing<p></p>into Reformed, Mennonite, Anabaptist, and other denominations. A major<p></p>purpose of the diet called by Emperor Charles at Augsburg in 1530 was to<p></p>harmonize these various groups and attempt a final reconciliation with<p></p>Rome. To this end each body was to define its teaching in a statement or<p></p>confession, but not all were represented at the diet and only three were<p></p>actually submitted.<p></p><p></p>As usual the papists were laying for the Lutherans. They had prejudiced<p></p>the emperor against a fair hearing and were reserving their best<p></p>ammunition for the Saxon "heretics," fully confident that a Lutheran<p></p>defeat would speedily bring the downfall of the others.<p></p><p></p>Still under imperial ban, Luther could not attend the diet but stayed at<p></p>a castle in Coburg from which he advised Melanchthon and others<p></p>appearing before the emperor. The confession, a series of twenty-eight<p></p>articles setting forth the Lutheran position, was read on June 25. The<p></p>first twenty-one present fundamental doctrines of the Scriptures<p></p>regarding God, Original Sin, the Son of God, Justification, the Church,<p></p>the Sacraments, Civil Affairs, the Freedom of Will, the Cause of Sin,<p></p>Good Works, and the Worship of Saints; while the last seven treat of<p></p>Roman abuses which contradict the Word of God.<p></p><p></p>The emperor commissioned the Roman theologians to prepare a refutation.<p></p>On the basis of it he rejected the Lutheran confession, ordered church<p></p>property restored to Roman bishops, and forbade witnessing and the<p></p>printing or sale of Lutheran writings.<p></p><p></p>Dejected by their failure to reform the church, the Lutherans went home<p></p>in the fall of 1530 unaware that their confession would become a basic<p></p>creed of the largest Protestant body in the world.<p></p><p></p>Threatened with coercion by the Romanists in Germany, they joined with<p></p>other Protestants in 1531 to form the League of Schmalkalden. War was<p></p>averted when the emperor enlisted both groups to meet the Turkish<p></p>invasion of Austria, and armed conflict over religious principles was<p></p>delayed until the summer of 1546. Luther didn't see it. A few months<p></p>earlier he went to stand before the Judge he had learned to love instead<p></p>of fear.<p></p><p></p><p></p>                            Back to Eisleben<p></p><p></p>The circuit of Luther's life was completed in Eisleben, his birthplace,<p></p>where he had gone to mediate between the princes of Mansfeld. He died<p></p>early on the morning of February 18, 1546, after fervently committing<p></p>himself to God's keeping and reaffirming the doctrines he had preached.<p></p><p></p>Luther's lifetime was marked with concern--concern first about himself<p></p>and God. It wasn't selfish; a man has to find his treasure before he can<p></p>share it. Luther had searched through lonely tormented hours in a<p></p>monastery; he brushed aside centuries of proud speculation until he<p></p>found the truth. It was written in a book, the record of God's<p></p>revelation of himself to man--the Bible. From it he learned that God is<p></p>love instead of wrath; that no one, pope or king, can stand between man<p></p>and that love, or gain it for another; that one can't even win it for<p></p>himself. It is God's free gift.<p></p><p></p>Then his concern was for others. This treasure was too priceless to<p></p>keep; he had to give it away. He preached it, though all the forces of<p></p>evil railed against him. He printed it, though emperors ordered him to<p></p>stop the press. He sang it and helped the church to sing--in tones so<p></p>soft they lull a child to sleep; in battlecries resounding from the<p></p>ramparts of his mighty-fortress God.<p></p><p></p>"The devil prefers blockheads," he said, therefore, "the school must be<p></p>the next thing to the church." Concern led him to teach. Professor was<p></p>the only job he held--but that for all his life. He hated those who<p></p>arrogantly claimed sole right to knowledge. So that each might know the<p></p>truth himself, and in that truth be free, he translated the sacred<p></p>Scriptures. Matthew to Revelation first, and then the Old Testament were<p></p>translated, not in high-sounding phrase or platitude, but in majestic<p></p>simplicity--the words of Hans and Hilda. The lords and ladies would<p></p>understand it that way too.<p></p><p></p>The principles of faith which Luther proclaimed, brought fame and the<p></p>promise of power. But the words addressed to the nobles at Worms recount<p></p>the humility of his service: "I seek nothing beyond reforming the church<p></p>in conformity with the Scriptures. I reserve nothing but to bear witness<p></p>to the Word of God alone."<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>                               CHRONOLOGY<p></p><p></p><p></p>  1483   November 10       Martin Luther born at Eisleben<p></p>  1484                     Family moves to Mansfeld<p></p>  1497                     Luther goes to Magdeburg school<p></p>  1498                     Luther goes to Eisenach school<p></p>  1501                     Enters University of Erfurt<p></p>  1505                     Receives master of arts degree<p></p>         July 2            Vows to become a monk<p></p>         July 17           Enters Augustinian cloister at Erfurt<p></p>  1507   April 4           Ordained to priesthood<p></p>  1508                     Teaches at Wittenberg<p></p>  1509                     Lectures at University of Erfurt<p></p>  1510   November          Begins journey to Rome<p></p>  1511                     Returns to Wittenberg as professor<p></p>  1512   October 18-19     Receives doctor of sacred scripture<p></p>                           degree<p></p>  1517   October 31        Posts ninety-five theses<p></p>  1518   August            Pope wants Luther brought to Rome<p></p>  1519   July 4-14         Luther debates with Eck at Leipzig<p></p>  1520   June 15           Papal bull signed<p></p>         October 10        Luther receives bull<p></p>         December 10       Luther burns bull<p></p>  1521   January 27        Diet of Worms begins<p></p>         April 16          Arrives at Worms<p></p>         April 17          Makes first statement<p></p>         April 18          Luther will not recant<p></p>         April 26          Leaves Worms<p></p>         May 4             Arrives at the Wartburg<p></p>         May 26            Banned by Edict of Worms<p></p>  1522   March 6           Returns to Wittenberg<p></p>  1525   June 13           Marries Katherine von Bora<p></p>  1527                     Composition of "A Mighty Fortress"<p></p>  1530   June 25           Augsburg Confession read<p></p>  1534                     Publishes complete Bible in German<p></p>  1546   February 18       Luther dies at Eisleben<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>                          Transcriber's Notes<p></p><p></p><p></p>--Retained publication information from the printed edition: this eBook<p></p>  is public-domain in the country of publication.<p></p><p></p>--Corrected a few palpable typographical errors.<p></p><p></p>--In the text versions only, text in italics is delimited by<p></p>  _underscores_.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK MARTIN LUTHER ***<p></p><p></p><p></p>    <p></p><p></p>Updated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will<p></p>be renamed.<p></p><p></p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright<p></p>law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,<p></p>so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United<p></p>States without permission and without paying copyright<p></p>royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™<p></p><p></p>Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of<p></p>electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of<p></p>computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It<p></p>exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations<p></p>from people in all walks of life.<p></p><p></p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the<p></p>assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s<p></p>goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will<p></p>remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project<p></p>Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure<p></p>and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future<p></p>generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary<p></p>Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see<p></p>Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.<p></p><p></p>Section 3.

The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification<p></p>number is 64-6221541.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg<p></p>Literary Archive Foundation<p></p><p></p>Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread<p></p>public support and donations to carry out its mission of<p></p>increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be<p></p>freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest<p></p>array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations<p></p>($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt<p></p>status with the IRS.<p></p><p></p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating<p></p>charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United<p></p>States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a<p></p>considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up<p></p>with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations<p></p>where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND<p></p>DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state<p></p>visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.<p></p><p></p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we<p></p>have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition<p></p>against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who<p></p>approach us with offers to donate.<p></p><p></p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make<p></p>any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from<p></p>outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.<p></p><p></p>Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation<p></p>methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other<p></p>ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To<p></p>donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.<p></p><p></p>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works<p></p><p></p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project<p></p>Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be<p></p>freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and<p></p>distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of<p></p>volunteer support.<p></p><p></p>Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed<p></p>editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in<p></p>the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not<p></p>necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper<p></p>edition.<p></p><p></p>Most people start at our website which has the main PG search<p></p>facility: www.gutenberg.org.<p></p><p></p>This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,<p></p>including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary<p></p>Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to<p></p>subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.<p></p><p></p><p></p>

His book La Guerra de Guerrillas (Guerrilla Warfare in the 1985 English translation), which was first published in 1961, is one of the most important publications on guerrilla warfare in the world. This book, along with certain articles he wrote, in particular his “Guerra de Guerrillas: Un Metodo” (“Guerrilla Warfare: A Method,” published in Gerassi 1968a:266–79), provide a complete theory of revolutionary guerrilla warfare, largely based on the Cuban experience. This theory has influenced revolutionary movements throughout Latin America and the rest of the world and has inspired many radical groups to start a revolutionary guerrilla foco (focal point or center of guerrilla operations) like the one established by Fidel Castro, Che, and their comrades in the Sierra Maestra of Cuba.<p></p><p></p>During his days as a guerrilla leader in the Sierra Maestra, Che made it a habit to write down his daily observations in a personal campaign diary. At the end of a long day’s march or after an engagement with the enemy, he always sat down somewhere apart from the others to write about the events of the day. On the basis of these notes he was later able<p></p> 
106	CHE GUEVARA<p></p><p></p>to formulate his theories about guerrilla warfare and to write an excellent historical account of the Cuban revolutionary war, Pasajes de la Guerra Revolucionaria (Episodes of the Revolutionary War, 1996).<p></p><p></p>It was Che’s belief that the Cuban Revolution clearly demonstrated that the people of Latin America can liberate themselves from dictatorial rule if they resort to guerrilla warfare. In La Guerra de Guerrillas (Guerrilla Warfare), Che wrote that the Cuban Revolution had made three funda-mental contributions to revolutionary thought in Latin America. First, the Cuban experience proved that popular, irregular forces could win a war against a professional army. Second, it proved that it is not necessary to wait until all the conditions for revolution are present. According to Che, the insurrectional guerrilla foco can itself create the necessary conditions.<p></p><p></p>Third, Che believed Cuba demonstrated that, in Latin America, which has a large rural population, a successful revolutionary struggle must initially concentrate on the rural areas and not the cities if it is to succeed. Che claimed that the first two of these contributions refuted the arguments of those who claimed to be revolutionaries but refused to take any revolutionary action because of the pretext that they could not de-feat a professional army or because the necessary “objective conditions” for revolution did not exist in Latin America.<p></p><p></p>He believed a nucleus of 30 to 50 men could establish and consolidate a revolutionary guerrilla foco in any country of Latin America, provid-ing they were determined, had the cooperation of the people, and had perfect knowledge of the terrain where they would be operating. Che also stressed that the people must believe it is impossible for them to obtain social and economic reforms through peaceful means before they will be inclined to support an insurrectionary guerrilla foco. Moreover, he argued that where a government has risen to power by some form of popular consent, including fraudulent elections, and maintains at least the appearance of constitutional legality, it is impossible to establish and consolidate a guerrilla foco because many of the people will believe that there is some possibility of improving their social and economic condi-tions through legal means.<p></p><p></p>Che disagreed with those who argued that the revolutionary struggle in Latin America depended primarily on the political mobilization of the discontented urban masses in the cities. He felt that it was far more dif-<p></p> 
REVOLUTIONARY GUERRILLA WARFARE	107
<p></p>ficult to carry out a successful insurrection in the cities, where the armed forces and police can be effectively concentrated and utilized, than in the rural areas, where regular troops are at the mercy of a highly mobile guerrilla force supported by the rural population. The support of the rural population, according to Che, is the sine qua non of guerrilla warfare. In fact, he defined guerrilla war as a war of the people, led by a fighting vanguard (the nuclear guerrilla force) against the forces of the ruling oli-garchies (elites) and their foreign backers (the U.S. government and the transnational corporations with investments in the Third World). Thus, in Che’s view, the guerrilla force does not seize power by itself; rather, it serves as a catalyst that inspires the people themselves to take up arms and overthrow the established regime.<p></p><p></p>In La Guerra de Guerrillas, Che wrote that without the support of the people a guerrilla force is nothing more than a roving gang of bandits. He noted that both have the same characteristics: homogeneous mem-bership, respect for their leaders, courage, knowledge of the terrain, and appreciation of the correct tactics to employ against numerically supe-rior forces. However, they differ in one fundamental respect: one has the support of the people and the other does not. Consequently, bandits are inevitably hunted down and eliminated, whereas guerrilla forces, which count on the support of the people, can defeat a professional army and bring about the downfall of the most oppressive regime.<p></p><p></p>A guerrilla force, according to Che, wins the support of the masses in rural areas largely by championing their grievances. This means that the guerrillas must present themselves as crusaders intent on righting the in-justices of the prevailing social order. Che believed that the major griev-ances shared by the rural masses throughout Latin America arose from the concentration of land ownership in the hands of a small, wealthy, landed elite. Thus, the great majority of the peasantry do not own the land on which they live and work. Consequently, he saw land reform as the key issue to be used by guerrilla forces in their effort to win the sup-port of the rural masses. In other words, Che argued that the guerrilla fighter must be an agrarian revolutionary who uses the peasantry’s hunger for land as the basis for mobilizing its support.<p></p><p></p>He also believed that any revolutionary guerrilla force must be the conscience of the people, and that the moral behavior of the guerrillas must be such that the people regard them as true priests of the social<p></p> 
108	CHE GUEVARA<p></p><p></p>reforms that they advocate. According to Che, guerrilla fighters must always exercise rigid self-control and never permit themselves a single excess or weakness. This means guerrillas must be ascetics whose moral behavior earns them the respect and admiration of the local population. In addition, Che wrote it is the duty of guerrillas to give technical, eco-nomic, and social assistance to the peasantry. In this way, they develop a close relationship with the peasantry, which allows them to win their trust and confidence. Once this relationship has been achieved, it then becomes the task of the guerrillas to indoctrinate the peasantry about the fundamental importance of the armed struggle as the only way they can liberate themselves from their present state of exploitation and op-pression. Che believed that the successful execution of this task brings into existence a true people’s war and the inevitable destruction of the existing regime.<p></p><p></p>One of Che’s most original contributions to the literature on guerrilla warfare is his discussion of the qualities of the guerrilla fighter. According to him, the ideal guerrilla soldier is an inhabitant of the zone where the nuclear guerrilla foco is established. This is because the two most impor-tant prerequisites of successful guerrilla warfare are a thorough knowledge of the terrain and the cooperation of the local population. The guerrilla who inhabits the region where he or she operates knows the terrain and has friends in the area to turn to for help. It follows, therefore, that in Latin America the local campesino (peasant) makes the best guerrilla soldier, although Che emphasized that a guerrilla force should not be composed exclusively of campesinos.<p></p><p></p>Che seems to have been describing himself without knowing it when he listed the personal qualities that the ideal guerrilla soldier should have. He stressed audacity and a readiness to take an optimistic attitude at times when an analysis of existing conditions does not warrant it. He also believed that the guerrilla fighter must be ready to risk his or her life almost daily and to voluntarily give it up if the circumstances require it. This of course demands a high degree of devotion to the cause for which the guerrillas are fighting, and according to Che, such devotion can be sustained only if the guerrilla movement is based on ideals that are meaningful to each guerrilla fighter. He concluded that among nearly all campesinos such an ideal is the right to have a piece of land of their own, while the ideal of adequate wages and better social conditions plays<p></p> 
REVOLUTIONARY GUERRILLA WARFARE	109
<p></p>a comparable role among guerrillas from the urban working classes and more abstract ideals, such as political freedom and social equality, moti-vate students and intellectuals.<p></p>In addition to the moral and psychological qualities that make a good guerrilla fighter, Che stressed that guerrillas must also have certain im-portant physical qualities and be able to adapt to the most difficult envi-ronmental conditions. As Che knew well from his own experience, the conditions of guerrilla life require enduring severe privations, including the lack of food, water, proper clothing, shelter, and medical attention. Moreover, guerrillas must be able to adapt to a life of almost constant movement, in which they are required to march long distances and tra-verse areas no ordinary man or woman would ever venture.<p></p><p></p>Che wrote that in terms of the general pattern of a guerrilla’s day-to-day life, combat is the most interesting event. Combat, therefore, is both the climax and the greatest joy in that life, only combat provides the means to fulfill the purpose for which the guerrilla exists. Che empha-sized that guerrillas must perform their role as combatants without any reluctance or weakness, since they must give the enemy no quarter and expect none in return. On the other hand, Che also made the point that wounded and captured enemy soldiers must be treated benevolently by guerrilla soldiers, unless they have committed criminal acts that require they be tried and perhaps executed.<p></p><p></p>The final objective of a revolutionary guerrilla war according to Che’s perspective is the defeat of the enemy’s army and the seizure of political power in the name of the people. However, he made it quite clear that guerrilla warfare cannot in itself bring about victory. He emphasized that it is important to remember that guerrilla warfare is only the first phase of a war of national liberation and that, unless it develops into a conven-tional war, the enemy cannot be completely defeated.<p></p><p></p>Che wrote that in a revolutionary guerrilla war’s earliest stages the primary strategy of the revolutionary guerrilla force is to assure its own survival. This means that it must flee from and avoid the enemy forces sent to destroy it. During this phase, it must restrict its offensive activi-ties to lightning attacks on unsuspecting enemy posts or units and in each case retreat to a secure hiding place before the enemy has a chance to react with its superior forces and weapons. If the guerrilla force suc-ceeded in eluding the enemy forces sent to destroy it, Che assumed it<p></p> 
110	CHE GUEVARA<p></p><p></p>would increasingly attract recruits from the rural population and gradu-ally enlarge the scale of its operations, striking more frequently at the enemy troops in the zone surrounding the guerrilla foco. In this way, the guerrillas begin to weaken and demoralize the enemy’s forces. By system-atically harassing the enemy through surprise attacks, they also disrupt communications and force the enemy onto the defensive.<p></p><p></p>The next phase involves extending the territory of guerrilla activity by sending small groups deep into enemy territory to sabotage and terror-ize the enemy’s key centers of supply and communications. Meanwhile, the original base of guerrilla operations must be continually strengthened and measures must be taken to indoctrinate the inhabitants of the guer-rilla zone. Later, when more fighters and arms have been obtained and the circumstances appear to warrant an expansion of the conflict, new guerrilla columns are formed and sent to operate in areas behind the enemy’s lines.<p></p><p></p>The final phase of the struggle begins, according to Che, when the guerrilla columns unite and engage the enemy’s forces in a conventional war of fixed fronts. It is at this moment that the people’s army comes into existence and the drive toward the cities begins. The death knell of the old order comes as the urban masses turn on the defending troops and the last strongholds of enemy resistance surrender to the people’s army. This clears the way for the revolutionary leaders to seize power and begin the building of a new society. “Above all it must be made clear that this type of struggle is a method: a method for achieving a purpose. That purpose, indispensable and unavoidable for every revolutionary, is the conquest of political power” (Guevara 1963).<p></p><p></p>Che warned that a people’s army does not emerge spontaneously and that victory is obtained only after a long and difficult struggle in which the people’s forces and their leaders are exposed to repeated attacks by superior forces intent on annihilating them. He also pointed out that the guerrillas must expect to suffer greatly at the hands of the enemy. Che made this point most effectively in the following passage from his article “Guerrilla Warfare: A Method,” which prophetically describes the situa-tion his guerrilla force encountered in Bolivia:<p></p><p></p>The enemy army will punish them severely. At times they will be split up into groups, and those who fall prisoner will be tortured.<p></p> 
REVOLUTIONARY GUERRILLA WARFARE	111
<p></p>They will be hounded relentlessly like hunted animals in the areas they have chosen for their operation. They will suffer the con-stant uneasiness of having enemies at their heels, and they will constantly have to suspect all they encounter, since the frightened peasants will in some instances hand them over to the repressive troops in order to rid themselves of the latter by removing the rea-son for their presence. Their only alternative will be death or vic-tory, at times when death is a thousand times present and victory is a myth about which only a revolutionary can dream. (in Gerassi 1968:276)<p></p><p></p>However, Che argued that even if only a fragment of the original guer-rilla nucleus survives, it can continue to spark the revolutionary spirit of the masses and can organize anew to carry on the struggle.<p></p>Che believed that war is subject to a series of scientific laws and that those who disregard these laws are destined to be defeated. Since guer-rilla warfare is merely one type of war, he claimed that it was governed by the same laws. However, because of its special aspects, Che argued that guerrilla warfare is also governed by a series of accessory laws or principles that must be recognized by a guerrilla force hoping to succeed.<p></p><p></p>Since one of the precepts of guerrilla warfare is the enemy’s vast su-periority in troops as well as in equipment, Che stressed that the guer-rillas must utilize special tactics that allow them to offset the enemy’s superiority in troops and equipment. These tactics are based, as already mentioned, on two essential preconditions: (1) the guerrillas must be highly mobile, and (2) they must possess a much greater knowledge of the terrain than the enemy.<p></p><p></p>Extreme mobility and a detailed knowledge of the terrain of opera-tions make it possible, in Che’s opinion, for the guerrillas to outmaneu-ver and surprise the numerically superior and better-equipped forces sent against them. With these capabilities, they can strike when the enemy is off guard and then quickly disappear before retaliation, thus infl icting heavy casualties on the enemy with very few or no losses of their own. “Strike and run, wait, watch carefully, and then again strike and run” (Guevara 1963). This, in Che’s words, is the primary tactic of guerrilla warfare, to be repeated over and over until the enemy is de-moralized and forced to take a static and essentially defensive posture.<p></p> 
112	CHE GUEVARA<p></p><p></p>The basic characteristics of this tactic are the element of surprise and the rapidity of the guerrillas’ attacking and withdrawal maneuvers. The speed and surprise inherent in this tactic give the guerrillas a great ad-vantage over the enemy’s larger and better-equipped forces. Moreover, Che noted that it is particularly effective when used at night and that, for this reason, one of the basic features of guerrilla warfare is night fi ghting.<p></p><p></p>Somewhat more static than the hit-and-run technique, but just as ef-fective, is the ambush. This tactic is, of course, as old as war itself and has always been used by the weak against the strong. It requires that the enemy be on the move, ideally marching in file through a ravine, can-yon, or pass, where the forces can be caught in a devastating crossfire. However, Che made an original contribution to this age-old tactic. In his writings, Che mentions the psychological damage inflicted on the enemy if the guerrillas always concentrate their fire on the advance elements of the army units they ambush. The enemy’s soldiers realize they can expect almost certain death if they are in the advance positions of a column. This tactic, Che claimed, creates panic among the soldiers and may even lead them to mutiny if they are ordered to take the lead positions in a column marching through a suspected guerrilla area.<p></p><p></p>In addition to the ambush and the rapid hit-and-run type of attack, Che also wrote about what is called the “minuet tactic.” Somewhat anal-ogous to the dance of the same name, this tactic involves surrounding an enemy column with several small groups. These groups alternately engage the enemy from different points. As soon as one group retreats, another one initiates an attack from a different direction. As a result, the enemy column is constantly kept off balance and demoralized. In fact, if the guerrillas have enough men and ammunition and there is no possibil-ity of the surrounded enemy column receiving outside aid, the guerrillas can annihilate the entire column.<p></p><p></p>Che emphasized that a guerrilla force must never allow itself to be encircled, for experience had shown, he said, that the only really effec-tive way of stamping out a guerrilla force is to encircle the guerrillas in a given area, concentrate as many troops in the circle as possible, and progressively close in around the guerrillas until they are liquidated. For this reason, guerrilla warfare is a war without any fixed front or battle lines. According to Che, the guerrillas must appear and disappear at the<p></p> 
REVOLUTIONARY GUERRILLA WARFARE	113
<p></p>enemy’s rear, at the flanks, and in its midst. In the initial stages, guerril-las should rarely attempt to hold a given position, since their concern is to avoid encirclement or a frontal encounter with the enemy’s superior forces. Instead, their aim should be to inflict as many casualties on the enemy’s forces as possible without jeopardizing themselves. Confronted with this type of irregular warfare, Che claimed that the enemy’s regular army is rendered powerless. Since the army is equipped and trained to fight a conventional war or control the street demonstrations of students and workers, it becomes frightened and demoralized when faced with the tactics of the guerrillas.<p></p><p></p>Since one of the most important aspects of guerrilla warfare is the relationship between the guerrillas and the local population, Che be-lieved that the guerrillas should conduct themselves at all times in the most respectful manner toward civilians. For this reason, he advocated that they always pay for any goods taken, or at least give a certifi cate of debt to be paid at some future date. He also emphasized that the zone of guerrilla operations must never be impoverished by the direct action of the guerrillas and that the local inhabitants must be permitted to sell their products outside the guerrilla zone, except under extreme circum-stances. As the guerrilla effort progresses and whole areas of a country come under their control, then, according to Che, the guerrillas must assume responsibility for governing the civilian population and regu-lating economic activity in the areas under their control.<p></p><p></p>Although Che believed sabotage was one of the most effective tac-tics available to a revolutionary guerrilla movement, he was opposed to terrorism per se. He believed that terrorism is a negative weapon that can turn the people against a revolutionary movement. Moreover, in his opinion, the results of terrorist attacks are not worth the cost in lives that they entail. On the other hand, he distinguished sabotage (the de-struction of essential industries and public works) from terrorism (the systematic use of violence to coerce the population) and advocated the destruction of nearly everything necessary for normal, modern life, for example, telephone lines, electrical power stations, water mains, sewers, gas pipelines, railroads, and radio and television stations. Yet even in the case of sabotage, Che pointed out that a guerrilla force must consider the social consequences of each act of destruction so as not to cause unneces-sary suffering among the urban and rural masses.<p></p> 
114	CHE GUEVARA<p></p><p></p>For Che, one of the most important characteristics of guerrilla war-fare is the difference between the information possessed by the guerrillas and that possessed by the enemy. He saw the situation as one in which the enemy’s regular forces must constantly operate in areas where they encounter the sullen silence of the local inhabitants, while the guerrillas can count on a friend in every house who will pass information about the enemy’s movements along to the guerrilla headquarters or the guerrilla force operating in the area. Che believed that this is one of the greatest advantages enjoyed by guerrillas and that it should be utilized to the full-est extent.<p></p><p></p>However, in Che’s opinion, a guerrilla force should never confide too much in the local peasantry, since peasants have a natural tendency to talk to their friends and relatives about everything they see and hear. Moreover, in view of the brutal way the regular troops treat the local population in an area where guerrillas are known to be operating, he warned that it is to be expected that some will give the enemy informa-tion about the guerrillas in order to escape torture or mistreatment.<p></p><p></p>Since Che conceived of guerrilla warfare as a revolutionary war of the people in which the guerrillas serve as the revolutionary vanguard, he repeatedly emphasized throughout his writings that the support of the masses was crucial to the success of any guerrilla insurgency. Therefore, he was preoccupied with treating in detail how a guerrilla force secures and develops popular support. For this reason, his writings on revolu-tionary guerrilla war come closer to being a manual on how to organize and successfully execute a popular revolution than a theoretical work on military strategy and tactics.<p></p><p></p>Most revolutionary movements in Latin America following the Cuban revolution were based on Che’s contention that a small band of from 30 to 50 guerrillas can create the conditions required for a revolution-ary victory in any country of Latin America. Most of these movements, including the one directed by Che himself, failed to demonstrate that an insurrectionary guerrilla foco located in a rural area could, by itself, produce a successful popular revolution.<p></p><p></p>The Cuban revolution was not purely a peasant revolution, mounted by a small guerrilla force that came down out of the mountains to liberate the cities. Che knew this. There is much more to the story of the Cuban Revolution than this. To be sure, the guerrillas were the symbol of the<p></p> 
REVOLUTIONARY GUERRILLA WARFARE	115
<p></p>revolution, and they played a crucial role in its development. However, Cuba’s urban working and middle classes, who threw their weight behind the guerrillas because of their hatred of the corrupt Batista regime, and the weakness of the Cuban army, which was not enthusiastic about de-fending the unpopular regime, played decisive roles. Moreover, if Castro had put forward a more radical program of social and economic reforms prior to his seizure of power, the revolutionary movement against Batista would not have been able to acquire the magnitude of popular support that made its victory possible.<p></p><p></p>Ironically, the international importance and historical significance of the Cuban Revolution may well have made another Cuban-style revolu-tion in Latin America very difficult to achieve. It is hard to imagine a similar revolutionary guerrilla movement today either (1) deceiving the upper and middle classes into believing it has moderate political aims, or (2) winning the support of U.S. and international public opinion as romantic freedom fighters combating a tyrannical regime. The political elites in Latin America have learned a lot from the Cuban Revolution and subsequent attempts to replicate it. They now know that a revolu-tionary guerrilla force must be eliminated as soon as it appears, that the army must be effectively trained in counterinsurgency warfare, and that serious efforts must be made to win the support of the peasantry or at least to forestall their giving support to a revolutionary movement.<p></p><p></p>However, Che’s theory of revolutionary guerrilla warfare overempha-sized the importance of the rural population as the popular base for a successful revolutionary movement in Latin America. The armies of a number of Latin American countries, using modern counterinsurgency tactics that their officers have learned from U.S. advisors and training programs, have shown that they can defeat or at least contain Cuban-style revolutionary guerrilla movements that rely principally on a rural base of support.<p></p><p></p>But even more important is the obvious fact, recognized by most Latin Americans interested in revolution, that the main breeding grounds for any kind of radical popular movement in Latin America are the cities and towns. The cities are inundated with migrants from the rural areas. Hoping to break away from the poverty and misery of rural Latin Amer-ica, they generally fi nd waiting for them in the cities unemployment and worse living conditions than they had in the rural areas. The<p></p> 
116	CHE GUEVARA<p></p><p></p>frustration and discontent that derive from this situation provide a fer-tile soil for radical political groups. Thus, today and in the future, the exploding urban centers offer an important base of potential popular sup-port for radical political movements in Latin America and in other parts of the world with similar social and economic conditions.<p></p>Nevertheless, it is important to note that in a modified form Che’s ideas on guerrilla warfare and the Cuban model of the catalytic guer-rilla foco were adopted with some success by armed revolutionary move-ments in Central America in the 1970s and the 1980s. The success of the Sandinista Front for National Liberation (Frente Sandinista de Liberación Nacional, or FSLN) in overthrowing the Somoza dictatorship in Nicaragua at the end of the 1970s is perhaps the best example of a successful revolutionary movement in Latin America that began with a rural-based guerrilla force similar to that recommended by Che. How-ever, the FSLN, which was backed by Che and the Cubans in the sixties, succeeded in overthrowing the Somoza regime in the 1970s because it combined guerrilla warfare in the countryside with a successful campaign of urban guerrilla warfare and the development of a multiclass, multi-party political alliance—not that different from what occurred in Cuba. This broad-based political alliance helped the FSLN mobilize a nation-wide popular insurrection that toppled the Somoza regime (Harris and Vilas 1995).<p></p><p></p>For those who believe a rural-based armed insurrection is no longer viable, with the end of the cold war and modern military methods, the surprise appearance on the contemporary scene of the Zapatista revolu-tionary movement in southern Mexico in the mid-1990s provides clear evidence that guerrilla movements similar to the type advocated by Che Guevara continue to arise in Latin America and other parts of the world where extreme social injustices persist. And the striking resemblance of the Zapatistas’ charismatic spokesperson, Subcomandante Marcos, to Che is certainly no accident of history. Not only does Marcos project a revolutionary persona modeled to a large degree on Che’s iconic revo-lutionary image but he mentions him frequently in his speeches and in-terviews. The Zapatista movement has more modest political goals and has used less aggressive military tactics than Che and his comrades, but this revolutionary movement, which has emerged from the largely rural, indigenous peasant population of the state of Chiapas clearly reflects the<p></p> 
REVOLUTIONARY GUERRILLA WARFARE	117
<p></p>legacy of Che’s revolutionary example. Many of his ideas about imperi-alism, revolution, socialism, and guerrilla warfare have clearly influenced the ideology and tactics of this revolutionary movement (Anderson 1997:753). The relative success and international attention given to this movement have also helped to create renewed interest in Che’s ideas about revolutionary guerrilla warfare.<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Chapter 7<p></p><p></p>CHE’S IDEAS ABOUT IMPERIALISM AND SOCIALISM<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Che silently resigned his cabinet post in Fidel Castro’s government and disappeared from public view in 1965 (Deutschmann 1994:27–31). There was a great deal of speculation at the time about his disappearance. Some believed Che and Castro had had a serious disagreement and Che had been imprisoned or secretly executed. There were also reports that Che had been killed in the Dominican Republic during the civil war that took place there in the spring of 1965. Later on, there was speculation that Castro or elements within the Cuban regime had eliminated Che because of his opposition to certain policies advocated by the political faction within the Cuban Communist Party that believed Cuba should follow the advice of Cuba’s advisors from the Soviet Union and the so-cialist Eastern European countries (such as Czechoslovakia, Poland, and East Germany) closely tied to the Soviet Union.<p></p><p></p>By the beginning of 1964, it was evident even to Che that his four-year plan initiated in 1961 to industrialize Cuba was having great difficulties. He realized he and many of his comrades had underestimated the dif-ficulties involved in transforming Cuba from a largely agrarian economy dominated by the production and exportation of sugar into an industrial-ized economy based on the production of a wide range of agricultural as<p></p> 
120	CHE GUEVARA<p></p><p></p>well as manufactured products and the extensive application of modern technology (Taibo 1996:482–500). He made Herculean efforts in his posts as head of the national bank and minister of industry. He worked 16–18 hours a day and drove those around him to do the same. He had a genius for finding innovative solutions to the country’s problems as-sociated with its lack of technology and the technical skills needed for industrial development. However, his exemplary leadership and commit-ment to his responsibilities and ideals could not overcome the many organizational deficiencies, widespread lack of technology, shortage of replacement parts (caused largely by the U.S. economic blockade of Cuba), and the lack of trained cadres. All of these problems obstructed the expansion of both Cuba’s agricultural production and the develop-ment of its underdeveloped manufacturing sector.<p></p><p></p>On the basis of what Che told his friends, it is possible to ascertain what his thinking was during this period. In the first place, it is clear that Che was forced to admit that Cuba would have to return to its historical mode of livelihood, that is, the production of sugar for export. Yet he was not willing to accept the advice of Cuba’s Soviet and Eastern European advisors that the revolutionary government should abandon the goal of industrializing the country. He felt strongly that Cuba’s economic rela-tions with the socialist bloc of nations led by the Soviet Union should not be the same as those between capitalist countries. If Cuba could not industrialize by itself, as a result of its neocolonial legacy and the under-developed character of its economy, then, Che argued, the more devel-oped socialist countries such as the Soviet Union had an obligation to help Cuba. He thought the Soviet Union should finance Cuba’s long-term efforts to industrialize instead of expecting Cuba to serve primarily as the sugar mill for the socialist bloc.<p></p><p></p>Che found little sympathy for his ideas among the Soviet Union’s lead-ers and the Soviet advisors in Cuba. They regarded his plans to industri-alize Cuba as unrealistic and impractical. Even if Cuba were to succeed in transforming its economy with Soviet assistance, they argued that there would be an insufficient market for Cuba’s manufactured goods. More-over, they pointed out the island lacked most of the raw materials needed for heavy industries (Anderson 1997:488–89). They argued the size of Cuba’s internal market was not large enough to make the production of its own manufactured items economically justifiable and that, in view<p></p> 
IMPERIALISM AND SOCIALISM	121
<p></p>of Cuba’s political isolation, it could not expect to export manufactured products to any of its neighbors in the Western Hemisphere. When Che countered that Cuba would have an export market in Latin America as soon as the revolution was carried to other countries of Central and South America, the Soviets made it quite clear that they were not will-ing to risk basing their economic assistance to Cuba on this eventuality.<p></p><p></p>Che was also critical of the Soviet Union’s state capitalist economic system and its reliance on what he regarded as basically capitalist meth-ods of organization, management, and investment. In particular, Che felt that the Soviet system’s reliance on material incentives and a system of decentralized financial management in its state industries were con-tradictory to the development of a genuine socialist economy and the development of a socialist consciousness on the part of the workers (Ger-assi 1968a:292–316). Moreover, he suspected Moscow and Washington had entered into a tacit agreement to respect each other’s international spheres of influence, and as part of this agreement Moscow had promised to restrain Havana from promoting revolution throughout Latin Amer-ica and the Caribbean.<p></p><p></p>Che felt strongly that Cuba should firmly align itself with the newly independent Third World nations of Africa, the Middle East, and Asia and assist national liberation struggles and socialist revolutions throughout the still colonized parts of the Third World. This idea mo-tivated him to travel extensively throughout Africa and Asia during early 1965.<p></p><p></p>He went on an extended state visit to Africa, China, and then back to Africa during the fi rst three months of 1965. In Africa, Che visited Algeria, Mali, Congo-Brazzaville, Guinea, Ghana, Dahomey (Benin), Tanzania, and Egypt, where he met with important African and Arab leaders such as presidents Ahmed Ben Bella of Algeria, Kwame Nkru-mah of Ghana, Julius Nyerere of Tanzania, and Abdel Nasser of Egypt (Anderson 1997:620–21).<p></p><p></p>Che also made a trip to the People’s Republic of China with the official purpose of explaining Cuba’s position with regard to the grow-ing international conflict between the Soviet Union and China. The Chinese were upset over what they considered to be Cuba’s increasing support for the Soviet Union. Because of the growing tension between Cuba and China at the time, Che had only a brief, formal meeting<p></p> 
122	CHE GUEVARA<p></p><p></p>with China’s famous leader Mao Tse-tung, but he was able to meet at length with other top Chinese offi cials and discussed with them his ideas about a united anti-imperialist front to liberate the Third World from Western (U.S., British, French, Belgian, and Portuguese) impe-rialism.<p></p>Actually, Che’s views were closer to those held at the time by the Chi-nese leadership than to the Soviet Union’s, since he had become increas-ingly critical of the Soviet Union’s international relations. He considered the course adopted by the Soviet Union under Premier Nikita Khrush-chev to be a “rightist” deviation from socialism. He also considered the emphasis placed by the Soviet advisors in Cuba on continuing the coun-try’s specialization in sugar production, the use of material incentives to increase labor productivity, and allowing Cuba’s state enterprises to adopt financial self-management as contrary to the Cuban revolution-ary regime’s commitment to the rapid industrialization of the economy and the replacement of capitalist material incentives and methods of organization with communist moral incentives and methods of organi-zation. He predicted (correctly as it turned out) the Soviet Union and the Soviet bloc of socialist countries would return to capitalism if they continued to rely on capitalist market mechanisms, material incentives, and enterprise self-management (Anderson 1997:697).<p></p><p></p>Following his visit to China, he returned to Africa via Paris, where he learned definitively of the death of his friend Masetti in Argentina and his abortive effort to start a guerrilla foco there. From Paris he flew to Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, where he met with President Nyerere and with the representatives in Dar es Salaam of the armed guerrilla movements fight-ing for national independence at that time in the Portuguese colonies of Angola and Mozambique, white-settler-controlled Rhodesia (Zimba-bwe), and the former Belgian Congo (Taibo 1996:514–15). Among the representatives whom he met in Dar es Salaam were Gaston Soumaliot and Laurent Kabila, two of the leaders of the Congolese rebel movement that was then in control of the eastern portion of the Congo. Although he was not impressed by Soumaliot and most of the other representatives he met, he was favorably impressed by Kabila’s leftist views, which he found similar to his own, and acting on the authority that he had previ-ously received from Fidel Castro, Che offered to send to Kabila’s forces Cuban arms and military advisors.<p></p> 
IMPERIALISM AND SOCIALISM	123
<p></p>From Tanzania he went to Egypt, where he told President Nasser of his desire to go to the Congo at the head of the contingent of Cuban advisors he had promised Kabila. In February 1965, Che appeared as an observer at the second conference of the Organization of Afro-Asian Solidarity in Algeria, where he initiated a personal crusade to create an anti-imperialist front among the neutral nations of the Third World. In the speech he delivered at this conference, he criticized the social-ist countries for being the “accomplices of imperialist exploitation” and called on them to support popular revolutions in the neocolonial and colonial countries of the Third World, instead of pursuing their own self-ish foreign policy (Gerassi 1968:378–86).<p></p><p></p>The Soviet observers who were in attendance were outraged. Follow-ing the conference, both Ben Bella of Algeria and Nasser of Egypt tried to talk Che out of the idea of heading a Cuban contingent to the Congo. Nasser warned him that if he went to the Congo he would be considered a white man and that his involvement there could only turn out badly (Taibo 1996:517). Ben Bella was more supportive and allowed Che to establish a base in the hills overlooking Algiers, which he and represen-tatives of other Latin American revolutionary groups, supported by the Cuban government, used for training purposes and maintained as a sanc-tuary until Ben Bella was overthrown by a military coupe in June 1965.<p></p><p></p>When Che returned to Cuba in March 1965, he was ready to resign his position in the Cuban government in order to devote all his efforts to furthering the armed struggle against imperialism. Since he had played such an important role in the Cuban Revolution although not Cuban, he assumed be would be able to do the same elsewhere, not only in Latin America but this time in Africa.<p></p><p></p>Shortly after Che returned to Havana, he met with Fidel Castro to discuss the results of his travels and his views regarding the position Cuba should take in international affairs. At this meeting, it appears that Cas-tro reproached Che for criticizing the Soviet Union and the other social-ist countries in his speech at the Organization of Afro-Asian Solidarity in Algiers (Taibo 1996:522). Castro also made it clear that he was under both external and internal pressure to move Cuba closer to the Soviet Union in the growing split between the Soviet Union and revolution-ary China. In fact, the Soviets and the old-guard members of the Cuban Communist Party within the Cuban regime were pressing him to come<p></p> 
124	CHE GUEVARA<p></p><p></p>out openly in favor of the ideological position held by the leaders of the Soviet Union and against the more radical ideological line taken by the leaders of the People’s Republic of China. These former allies were now locked in an international struggle for the leadership of the international socialist movement.<p></p>Che’s radical brand of revolutionary socialist internationalism was not shared by the leadership of the Soviet Union and by the leaders of most of the pro-Soviet Communist parties in Latin America. The Soviet lead-ership regarded what they considered Che’s radical leftist adventurism to be a threat to their own international strategy of peaceful competition and coexistence with the United States and its allies. However, there appears to have been some sympathy for Che among the Soviet leaders, especially since his influence had been decisive in convincing Fidel Cas-tro to align Cuba with the Soviet Union shortly after the revolutionary government was formed in Cuba.<p></p><p></p>According to Feder Burlatsky, a former advisor to Soviet premier Khrushchev, the Soviet leadership disliked Che’s revolutionary adven-turism and they were afraid his example would lead the Cubans and other leftists in Latin America into taking actions that would provoke a major military confrontation between the Soviet Union and the United States (Anderson:581). But in an interview he gave to the journalist Jon Lee Anderson in 1995, Burlatsky claimed: “Even though Che was against our interests, there was still some sympathy for him. . . . There was a romantic aura around him; he reminded people of the Russian Revolution” (Anderson:581).<p></p><p></p>Anderson also interviewed Nikolai Metutsov, who was responsible for maintaining relations between the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Communist parties in the non-European socialist states such as Cuba and Vietnam. Metutsov told Anderson he “fell in love” with Che upon meeting him, because of his “very beautiful eyes,” and because his stare was “so generous, so honest,” and because he was impressed by the way he spoke with such impetus, “as if his words were squeezing you” (Anderson:585). According to Anderson, Metutsov’s appraisal was that Che’s views could not be easily classified.<p></p><p></p><p></p>Externally one could truly say that, yes, Che Guevara was contami-nated by Maoism because of his Maoist slogan that the rifle can cre-<p></p> 
IMPERIALISM AND SOCIALISM	125
<p></p>ate power. And certainly he can be considered a Trotskyite because he went to Latin America to stimulate the revolutionary move-ment there . . . but in any case I think these are external signs, su-perficial ones, and that deep down, what was most profound in him was his aspiration to help man on the basis of Marxism-Leninism. (Anderson:585)<p></p><p></p>Metutsov told Anderson that he thought that Che’s personal commit-ment to the cause of revolution was his “peculiarity.” He said Che’s dedication to armed struggle, while a source of worry for some mem-bers of the leadership of the Soviet Communist Party, was not per-ceived by the Soviet leadership as a whole to be a cause of signifi cant concern. Whether this last statement about their lack of concern was true is hard to assess now.<p></p><p></p>Che was committed to both fomenting revolution on a truly interna-tional scale and personally putting into practice his thesis that it was pos-sible for a small, if committed, guerrilla force to ignite a full-scale popular revolution in countries under the control of oppressive regimes backed by U.S. imperialism. His so-called peculiar commitment to these beliefs was shared by most of his closest friends and comrades as well as many admirers and sympathizers around the world. His commitment threat-ened the positions of the pro-Soviet leaders of the orthodox Communist parties in Cuba and elsewhere as well as many other leftist political par-ties and governments not aligned with the Soviet Union. Che openly criticized these parties and movements for their unwillingness to fight U.S. imperialism and to engage in an armed revolution to bring down the capitalist regimes in their countries and build socialist societies in their place.<p></p><p></p>Che realized, however, Cuba had no other alternative but to side with the Soviet Union. Che also knew his continued presence in the government was a liability. This was because of several reasons: his dis-agreements with the Soviets over their ideological line and their foreign policy, Cuba’s growing dependence on Soviet military aid and trade, and his desire to involve himself directly in the revolutionary struggles against imperialism taking place in Latin America and around the world.<p></p><p></p>He realized that it would be impossible for him to involve himself directly in a revolutionary struggle in Latin America or Africa if he continued to hold a high position in the Cuban government. The<p></p> 
126	CHE GUEVARA<p></p><p></p>international repercussions would have been too great for Cuba. In view of these circumstances, Che decided to resign his positions in the Cuban government and leave Cuba. His main interest was carrying the revolu-tion to South America, particularly his homeland Argentina. He had established ties with revolutionary groups throughout Latin America and in other parts of the world while he held his important positions in the Cuban government, and he now planned to use some of these connections to carry out his plans of taking an active leadership role in creating or aiding armed revolutionary movements in South America and Africa.<p></p><p></p>His friend and confidant Fidel Castro encouraged him to go to Af-rica and assist the revolutionary movement in the Congo, since he felt the conditions were not yet ready for him to go to South America. Cas-tro knew that he had become increasingly restless in his governmental posts in Cuba and was anxious to carry out what he considered to be his historic mission of liberating the Third World countries from Western imperialism and capitalist exploitation (Anderson 1997:628).<p></p><p></p>Of course, this meant resigning from his important positions in the Cuban government, and it meant leaving behind all that Che had ac-complished in Cuba as well as his wife and five children and most of his Cuban comrades (except for those who would accompany him first to the Congo and later to Bolivia). It was an extremely difficult and coura-geous decision for him to make. However, Che was a man who was to-tally committed to carrying out his convictions. His wife, Aleida March, knew this well. She had learned this by his side during the revolutionary war against the Batista dictatorship, and she always knew that one day he would leave her and their children to fulfill his chosen destiny—to fight to the death if necessary against imperialism and for the establishment of socialism.<p></p><p></p>In her book about their life together (March 2008), she discusses the tremendous sacrifi ces they both endured as a result of his total commitment to live by his revolutionary ideals—ideals that she shared wholeheartedly with him. The separations were almost unbearable for both of them, since they never knew when or whether they would see each other again. Indeed, she tried repeatedly to convince him to take her with him—both on his mission to the Congo and to Bolivia. But he convinced her the time was not right for her to join him and their<p></p> 
IMPERIALISM AND SOCIALISM	127
<p></p>young children needed her to stay with them until they were much older.<p></p>Che was very close to his five children even though they were very young when he left them—to his first child Hildita (Hilda Beatriz Gue-vara Gadea), who lived with her mother (his first wife, Hilda Gadea) in Havana, and to his four children with Aleida March: Aleida, Camilo, Celia, and Ernesto, who lived with him in Havana. He was also very much in love with Aleida. Therefore, his separation from Aleida and his children was very painful and he missed them deeply while he was in the Congo and Bolivia.<p></p><p></p>The personal side of Che and his many admirable personal traits are revealed beautifully in Aleida March’s book on their life together. She describes many intimate moments of touching tenderness and romantic love between them. In general, her account of their life together reveals both his continuing devotion to her and the sincere concern he always showed for her feelings and her personal welfare. During his long ab-sences from Cuba, he would write love letters and poems for her and make tape recordings to be given to her and the children. In the letters and poems he wrote for her, he nearly always referred to her as mi única, (my only one), and they all display great affection and longing for her.<p></p><p></p>For example, here is a fragment of a poem he wrote for Aleida upon his departure for Bolivia (March 2008:221):<p></p><p></p>Adiós, my only one,<p></p><p></p>do not tremble before the hungry wolves nor in the cold steppe of absence; by my heart I carry you<p></p>and together we will continue until the road fades away . . .<p></p><p></p>And in the last message she received from him in Bolivia, he wrote the following:<p></p><p></p>My only one:<p></p><p></p>I am taking advantage of the trip of a friend to send you these words, which could go by mail, but a “semi-official” road seems more intimate. I could tell you that I miss you to the point of los-ing sleep, but I know you would not believe me, so I will abstain.<p></p> 
128	CHE GUEVARA<p></p><p></p>But there are days in which the homesickness becomes uncontrol-lable and possesses me. On Christmas and New Years, above all, you don’t know how much I miss your ritual tears, below a sky of new stars that remind me of how little of my life I have devoted to personal affairs. (March 2008:225)<p></p><p></p>In this last communication with his wife, one can sense his homesickness and longing for her as well as the sadness he felt over how little of his life he had spent with her and their children. He ended this message with a “kiss for the little pieces of flesh [his children], all the rest” and a kiss for her that he said was “pregnant with sighs and anguish.”<p></p><p></p>This romantic personal side of Che’s life was little known to all but his inner circle of family and friends until Hilda Gadea published her book in the late seventies on her relationship with Che and more recently Aleida March published her book on their life together. In this regard, it is also important to recognize that the ideological cornerstone of Che’s revolutionary thinking and practice was not guerrilla warfare or armed revolution but his almost utopian concept of el hombre nuevo (the new man or human being). He used this concept to express the almost spiri-tual belief he held in the development of new socialist human being for the 21st century. In fact, he believed the development of this new type of human being was an essential aspect of the construction of a genuine socialist society. His belief in this ideal human being was an important source of inspiration for him and for those who adopted or were influ-enced by his views on socialism and the future development of humanity (Siles del Valle 1996:47–92).<p></p><p></p>Che was dedicated to living his life in accordance with his ideal con-cept of the new type of human being that would come into existence in the revolutionary struggle to build a new socialist world order for human-ity. Che believed this new type of human being would arise out of the revolutionary struggle to liberate humanity from the egoistic individu-alism, dehumanizing exploitation, and social alienation associated with capitalism.<p></p><p></p>Che felt the struggle against capitalism and the construction of a new socialist order required a new type of human being who would always be committed to making personal sacrifices for the good of others. Nowhere is this concept of el hombre nuevo presented more explicitly than in Che’s<p></p> 
IMPERIALISM AND SOCIALISM	129
<p></p>essay “Socialism and Man in Cuba,” written early in 1965 while he was traveling as a Cuban statesman in Africa. What follows are some brief excerpts from this essay (in Gerassi 1968:398–400).<p></p>He describes the characteristics of revolutionary 21st-century men and women who he hoped would arise out of the struggle to build a so-cialist society. First and foremost, he believed they would be guided by “strong feelings of love” for humanity. He wrote:<p></p><p></p>Let me say, at the risk of appearing ridiculous, that the true revolu-tionary is guided by strong feelings of love. It is impossible to think of a true revolutionary without this quality.<p></p><p></p>While he felt that there could be “no life outside of the revolution” for the men and women of the new socialist society, he also believed the revolutionary leaders of the 21st century would have to avoid falling into “dogmatic extremes” and “have a highly developed sense of justice and truth.” Thus, he wrote:<p></p><p></p>There is no life outside the revolution. In these conditions the revo-lutionary leaders must have a large dose of humanity, a large dose of a sense of justice and truth, to avoid falling into dogmatic extremes, into cold scholasticism, into isolation from the masses.<p></p><p></p>As for the level of social commitment required of the new human being, he believed very strongly that this commitment would require a great deal of personal sacrifice. In this regard, he seems to have been writing as much about himself as the new socialist human being when he wrote the following lines:<p></p><p></p>Each and every one of us punctually pays his share of sacrifice, aware of being rewarded by the satisfaction of fulfilling our duty, aware of advancing with everyone toward the new human being who is to be glimpsed on the horizon.<p></p><p></p>Che firmly believed this ideal new human being would develop in the fu-ture, despite the difficulties of achieving the level of social consciousness and social commitment required for this human development to take<p></p> 
130	CHE GUEVARA<p></p><p></p>place. Thus, he wrote: “the road is long and in part unknown,” but “we are aware of our limitations” and “we will make the twenty-first century human being, we ourselves!”<p></p>His widow, Aleida March, recounts in her book about their life together how Che’s closest friends and comrades felt that he was the best example of the new human being he wrote and spoke about so frequently. As Fidel Castro says in his memoir of Che (Deutschmann 1994:108–9):<p></p><p></p>He was a living example. It was his style to be the example, to set the example. He was a person with a great spirit of self-sacrifice, with a truly spartan nature, capable of any kind of self-denial. His policy was to set an example. We could say that his entire life was an example in every sphere. He was a person of absolute moral in-tegrity, of remarkably firm principles, a complete revolutionary who looked toward the future, toward the humanity of the future, and who above all stressed human values, humanity’s moral values. . . .<p></p><p></p>None of the words I use about him involve the slightest exaggera-tion, the slightest overestimation. They simply describe the man we knew.<p></p> 
<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Chapter 8<p></p><p></p>THE SECRET MISSION<p></p><p></p>IN AFRICA<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Fidel Castro supported Che’s recommendations about providing Cuban support to the rebels in the Congo (later called Zaire), other liberation movements, and the new leftist governments in Africa. According to Castro, the rebels in the eastern Congo requested Cuban military assis-tance in 1964. In a 1987 interview with the Italian journalist Gianni Minà (Deutschmann 1994:118), which took place on the 20th anniver-sary of Che’s death, Castro said the following about Che’s involvement in the Congo:<p></p><p></p>At the time, white mercenaries had intervened in the former Belgian Congo, now Zaire. [President] Lumumba had been killed, a neocolonial regime was established, and a movement of armed struggle emerged in Zaire. We never made this public, but the rev-olutionary movement asked us for help and we sent instructors and combatants on an internationalist mission.<p></p><p></p>He also told Minà it was his idea that Che go with the Cuban force sent to the eastern Congo. In this regard, he said:<p></p> 
132	CHE GUEVARA<p></p><p></p>I myself suggested the idea to Che. He had time on his hands, he had to wait [before the conditions were more favorable for his long-hoped-for mission to South America]. . . . So we put him in charge of the group that was going to help the revolutionaries in what is today Zaire. . . . In all, about 100 Cubans went and stayed there several months. He followed the approach of teaching Zair-ians how to fi ght. Cuban and Zairian patriots fought white mer-cenaries and the forces sent by the government. . . . In the end the revolutionary leaders of the former Belgian colony decided to halt the struggle, and our personnel were withdrawn.<p></p><p></p>As Che’s wife, Aleida March, wrote in the foreword to his Congo di-ary: “Che, together with the group he led, aimed to strengthen as much as possible the liberation movement in the Congo, to achieve a united front, to select the best men and those prepared to continue the struggle for the final liberation of Africa” (Guevara 2000:xlv). And according to Che’s second in command in the Congo, Víctor Emilio Dreke, Che de-cided to participate in the Congo project after his African trip, even though this project went against his original idea of going to fight in Ar-gentina (page xxiv).<p></p><p></p>I suppose Che decided to participate in the project after his Afri-can trip. It went against his original idea to go to fight in Argen-tina. The assassination of Lumumba and the general situation in the Congo led him to take an interest in the guerrilla struggle there. It enabled him to follow a double objective: to prepare a group for Latin America, and to create a third front [against imperialism], in Vietnam, Latin America, and Africa. These were the ideas he wished to bring to fruition. Africa seemed easier than Latin Amer-ica. . . . The moment had come to act in Africa.<p></p><p></p>Moreover, according to Pablo Rivalta, the Cuban ambassador in Tan-zania who assisted Che’s Congo mission, Che saw the Congo as a good site for a training base for liberation movements that would revolutionize all the African countries and in particular, bring down the infamous white supremacist regime in South Africa.<p></p> 
THE SECRET MISSION IN AFRICA	133
<p></p>Despite the rumors at the time, Che’s disagreement with Castro re-garding Cuba’s relationship with the Soviet Union was not the reason for his departure from Cuba, and this disagreement did not end the long-standing friendship between them. Nor did Cuba’s relationship with the Soviet Union lead Castro to abandon his desire to see Cuba play an active role in the international struggle against U.S. and European imperialism. Castro was quite willing to send a contingent of Cubans, headed by Che, to assist the left-wing rebels in the Congo, who were then fighting against the pro-Western regime of Prime Minister Moise Tshombe.<p></p><p></p>The Congo became the scene of a bloody civil war following its independence from Belgium in 1960. The country’s first elected prime minister, Patrice Lumumba, was overthrown and then murdered by a U.S.-backed coup d’état in December 1960. When Tshombe, who was in-volved in Lumumba’s assassination, subsequently became the country’s head of state in 1964 with U.S. support, Lumumba’s followers launched an armed uprising against him. In November 1964, with the intent of crushing this uprising, the U.S. government provided planes to trans-port Belgian troops and white mercenaries to the Congo.<p></p><p></p>Because of the cold war confl ict at the time between the United States and its allies and the Soviet Union and its allies, the situation in the Congo became a major international political crisis. In December 1964, Fidel Castro sent Che to represent Cuba at the United Nations General Assembly in New York. In the well-publicized speech he gave at the General Assembly, Che denounced the involvement of the U.S. government and its allies in the Congo and other parts of Africa (Deut-schmann 1997:286–88).<p></p><p></p>In this speech, Che reminded the members of the General Assembly that Lumumba was murdered following the occupation of the country by a United Nations force that Lumumba had requested. He said this force had allowed his opponents to capture and kill Lumumba with impunity. He claimed the United States and other Western imperialist countries used the United Nations to depose Lumumba and kill thou-sands of Congolese, and their purpose was to defend the superiority of the white race in Africa and to continue Western imperialist control over the Congo’s vast mineral resources. And if this was not enough, he said, “the latest acts have fi lled the world with indignation” because<p></p> 
134	CHE GUEVARA<p></p><p></p>they allowed one of Lumumba’s murderers, Tshombe, to come to power illegally with the help of “Belgian paratroopers, carried by US planes, who took off from British bases” (Deutschmann:287).<p></p>Che went on to state: “Our free eyes open now on new horizons and can see what yesterday, in our condition as colonial slaves, we could not observe,” namely, that so-called Western civilization uses “a showy fa-çade” to disguise an ugly “picture of hyenas and jackals.” He ended his comments on the Congo crisis by saying: “All free men of the world must be prepared to avenge the crime of the Congo.” Only a few months later, in April 1965, Che led a secret contingent of 100 Cuban volunteers to assist the Congolese rebels, who were fighting both the Tshombe regime and what they considered its Western imperialist backers.<p></p><p></p>The idea of going to the Congo to assist the leftist rebels fighting the neocolonial regime there appealed to Che largely because of his fasci-nation with the idea of linking the nations of Africa, Asia, and Latin America together in a common struggle against Western imperialism. And despite the lack of enthusiasm for the idea among many of the Af-rican leaders he met on his previous his trip to Africa, Che wanted to establish a Cuban-led military training center in the eastern Congo. He hoped revolutionaries from all over the African continent would come to this base to train and gain valuable fi ghting skills and expe-rience that they would then take back to their respective countries (Anderson:623).<p></p><p></p>To prepare for the Congo expedition, Che removed himself from public view at the end of March 1965. By the end of April, his disap-pearance from public view had begun to cause a great deal of specula-tion both inside and outside Cuba about what had happened to him. On April 30, Fidel Castro was interviewed by a number of reporters, and in response to their questions about Che, he answered that he could say only that Che would always be where he could be of most use to the revolution. This statement, however, only served to intensify the specu-lation and rumors about Che’s disappearance.<p></p><p></p>Che wrote a confidential and rather personal letter of resignation to Castro when he left for the Congo. This letter (Gerassi 1968a:410–11), which Castro made public in October 1965, appears to have been de-signed among other purposes to absolve the Cuban government of all<p></p> 
THE SECRET MISSION IN AFRICA	135
<p></p>responsibility for Che’s actions in the Congo in the event he was discov-ered, captured, or killed there.<p></p><p></p>Fidel:<p></p><p></p>I remember at this hour many things, when we met at Maria Anto-nia’s house in Mexico, when you suggested that I come to Cuba, and the tension of the last minute preparations. One day they came around asking who to advise in case of death, and its real possibility struck us all. Afterward, we knew that it was certain, that in a rev-olution you die or triumph (if the revolution is a true one). Many of our comrades were left behind on the long road to victory. Today everything has a less dramatic tone because we are all more mature, but the same thing is repeating itself. I feel I have completed that part of my duty that has tied me to the Cuban revolution and so I say good-bye to you, our comrades, and to your people, who are now mine too.<p></p><p></p>I formally renounce my post in the directorate of the party, my post as minister, my rank of comandante, and my status as a Cuban. There is nothing legal that ties me to Cuba, only ties of another type that cannot be broken as in the case of offices. Making a summary of my past life, I think that I have worked with sufficient honesty and dedication to consolidate the success of the revolution. My only fault of any gravity is that I did not confide in you at the beginning in the Sierra Maestra and have not understood with sufficient clar-ity your qualities as a leader and revolutionary.<p></p><p></p>I have lived magnifi cent days at your side and I have felt the pride of belonging to our people in the dark and bright days of the Caribbean crisis [Bay of Pigs invasion by U.S.-backed Cuban ex-iles]. Rarely has a statesman shone as brightly as you in those days. I feel proud of having followed you without hesitation, identify-ing myself with your way of thinking, seeing and appreciating both the dangers and principles. Other lands of the world now claim the assistance of my modest efforts. I can do what you now are pre-vented from doing because of your responsibility at the helm of Cuba, and so the time has come to separate. Let it be known that I do this both in pleasure and sorrow: here I leave the purest of my<p></p> 
136	CHE GUEVARA<p></p><p></p>hopes as a builder and the most cherished of my loved ones and I leave a people who admitted me as one of their sons; this lacerates part of my spirit. To new fields of battle I will take the faith that you have given me, the revolutionary spirit of my people, and the feeling of carrying out the most sacred of duties: to fi ght against imperialism wherever it exists; this comforts and cures my pain abundantly.<p></p><p></p>Once again I say that I free Cuba of all responsibility, except that which comes from her example. If my last hour should come under other skies, my last thought will be for the Cuban people and especially for you. I am grateful for your teaching and example, and I will be faithful to you until my last act. I have always identifi ed myself with the foreign policies of our revolution and will con-tinue to do so. Wherever I go I will feel the responsibility of being a Cuban revolutionary, and I will act as one. I leave nothing ma-terial to my wife and children; and this doesn’t bother me for I am happy that it is this way. I ask nothing for them, since the state will provide them enough to live and will educate them. There are many things I could tell you and our people, but I feel that this is not necessary. Words cannot express what I want to say, and it is not worth while to fill sheets of paper. Victory always! Country or death! My embrace with all revolutionary fervor.<p></p><p></p>Che<p></p><p></p>When Che left for the Congo in April 1965, he led a handpicked group of mostly black Cubans who had fought with him and Castro in the Sierra Maestra. Their clandestine mission was carefully planned by Cuban intelligence, which planted a false report in the Dominican Re-public that Che had arrived in the capital of Santo Domingo in April and had been killed shortly thereafter in the civil war going on in that country at the time (Anderson 1997:638). Thus, while the CIA was look-ing for evidence of Che’s presence in the Dominican Republic, he and his companions were able to leave Cuba, travel to Africa, and enter the Congo with complete secrecy.<p></p><p></p>Che’s reasons for leaving Cuba in 1965 to go fight in the Congo and later in 1966 to establish a guerrilla training base in Bolivia were twofold. He felt his mission in life was to carry out the struggle for the liberation<p></p> 
THE SECRET MISSION IN AFRICA	137
<p></p>of Latin America and the rest of the Third World from imperialist dom-ination and capitalist exploitation. Moreover, he felt he would soon be too old to be able to physically carry out this kind of mission. Further-more, to carry out this kind of mission, he needed the freedom of action that he could gain only if he was no longer a high-profile official in the Cuban government. His official responsibilities required him to speak in the name of this government and to act in accordance with its policies and diplomatic relations (Taibo:530).<p></p><p></p>He felt it was necessary to free himself from the constraints imposed on him by his offi cial obligations as an important leader in the Cuban government so that he could return to the life of a revolutionary guer-rilla fi ghter and carry out the global struggle against Western imperial-ism, which he had come to consider his main mission in life. His total commitment to his convictions in this regard and the feeling that time was running out on his ability to fulfi ll his mission were his reasons for leaving Cuba in 1965.<p></p><p></p>According to Fidel Castro, he knew Che had wanted to go to fight in South America for many years, since the time Che joined the Cuban revolutionary movement in Mexico. In fact, Che told Castro then that once the Cuban revolution triumphed he wanted to be free to go fight in Argentina. Castro revealed this in his 1987 interview with the Italian journalist Gianni Minà (Deutschmann 1994:116).<p></p><p></p>Che very much wanted to go to South America. This was an old idea of his, because when he joined us in Mexico . . . he did ask one thing: “The only thing I want after the victory of the revolution is to go fight in Argentina”—his country—“that you don’t keep me from doing so, that no reasons of state will stand in the way.” And I promised him that. It was a long way off, after all. Firstly, no one knew if we would win the war or who was going to be alive at the end—and he surely, because of his impetuousness, had little chance of coming out alive. . . . Once in a while, in the Sierra and afterward, he would remind me of this plan and promise. He was certainly farsighted in this.<p></p><p></p>After the success of the Cuban revolution, Castro said Che “grew more enthusiastic about the idea of making a revolution in South America,”<p></p> 
138	CHE GUEVARA<p></p><p></p>and as the years went by he became increasingly impatient to carry out his desire to play an important role in this historic struggle.<p></p><p></p><p></p>CHE’S AFRICAN DIARY<p></p><p></p>Che realized shortly after arriving in the Congo that the rebels could not win because of their corrupt and weak leaders, their failure to organize support among the local population, their distrust of one another, and their hopeless lack of discipline. In this regard, it is relevant to note the following observation he made in what has become known as his Congo diary (Guevara 2000:235):<p></p><p></p>The leaders of the movement pass most of their time outside of the territory. . . . Organizational work is almost null, due to the fact that the mid-level leaders do not work, in fact they do not know how to work, and every one distrusts every one else. . . . Lack of dis-cipline and lack of self-sacrifi ce are the dominant characteristics of the guerrilla troops. Naturally, with these troops one cannot win a war.<p></p><p></p>In Tanzania after he was forced to leave the Congo, Che wrote a 153-page manuscript about the failure of his Congo mission. Che wrote this account of his Congo experience during his stay in the Cuban embassy in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, during the months he lived there in secrecy. This manuscript, Pasajes de la guerra revolucionaria: Congo, was kept se-cret for more than 30 years, until it was edited and fi rst published in 1999 by his wife Aleida March and Richard Gott (the English transla-tion was published in 2000. See Guevara 2000).<p></p><p></p>This ruthlessly honest document reveals among other things that Che decided he would accompany the contingent of armed Cubans sent to the Congo without fi rst informing and obtaining the consent of the Congolese rebel leaders such as Laurent Kabila. Thus, Che states in this document:<p></p><p></p>I hadn’t told any of the Congolese about my decision to fight there. In my fi rst conversation with Kabila I had not been able to do so<p></p> 
THE SECRET MISSION IN AFRICA	139
<p></p>because nothing had yet been decided, and after the plan was ap-proved [by Fidel Castro] it would have been dangerous for my project to be known before I arrived at my destination; there was a lot of hostile territory to cross. I decided, therefore, to present a fait accompli and act according to however they reacted to my pres-ence. I was not unaware of the fact that a negative would place me in a difficult position, because now I couldn’t go back, but I calcu-lated that it would be difficult for them to refuse me. (page 10)<p></p><p></p><p></p>Although the Congolese rebel leaders did not object to Che’s presence as the commander of the Cuban contingent, they were concerned about his presence in the Congo. Moreover, he found it difficult to meet with them and soon realized there was little prospect for the rebels to achieve victory since these leaders were ineffective and their forces were inca-pable of defeating the existing neocolonial regime, which had the back-ing of the Belgian, British, and U.S. governments.<p></p><p></p>Che also blamed himself for the failure of the Congo mission. He wrote: “I set off with more faith than ever in the guerrilla struggle, yet we failed. My responsibility is great; I shall not forget the defeat nor its most precious lessons. I learned certain things in the Congo. Some mis-takes I will never make again, others perhaps I will—and there will be new ones that I shall commit” (Guevara 2000:235).<p></p><p></p>Although he said he continued to have faith in his foco theory for creating a popular revolution, he made the following scathing critique of his own actions in the Congo:<p></p><p></p><p></p>I was at the head of a group of Cubans, no more than one company strong, and my function was to be their real leader who carried them to the victory that would hasten the development of a gen-uine popular army. My peculiar situation, however, made of me a soldier representing a foreign power, an instructor of Cubans and Congolese, a strategist, and a high flying politician in an unfamil-iar setting. . . . Had I been a more authentic soldier, I might have had more infl uence in the other spheres of my complicated rela-tionships. I have described how I reached the point of safeguard-ing the cadre (my own precious person) at particularly disastrous<p></p> 
140	CHE GUEVARA<p></p><p></p>moments in which I found myself, and how I allowed subjective considerations to gain the upper hand in the closing moments.<p></p><p></p>From this passage in his diary, it is clear that Che was deeply critical of his own behavior and the many limitations he confronted in the Congo. He engaged in this self-critique with a view to avoiding repetition in the future of the errors that he felt he had committed in the Congo.<p></p><p></p>However, Che’s subsequent mission to Bolivia appears to have failed for some of the same reasons as the Congo mission. For example, in Bolivia Che repeated the tactic of inserting himself secretly into another country at the head of a foreign military group and into a situation that lacked both the objective and subjective conditions necessary for a suc-cessful revolutionary movement.<p></p><p></p><p></p>THE LEGACY OF CHE’S MISSION IN AFRICA<p></p><p></p>It is interesting to note that although Che’s mission to the Congo was a bitter defeat for him and his Cuban companions, the lessons Cuba’s leaders learned from this unsuccessful effort to assist the Congolese rebels helped them to be much more successful in the military and political support they provided to liberation movements and leftist governments throughout Africa during the following decades. Without a doubt, the best example of this success was Cuba’s involvement in Angola.<p></p><p></p>Between April 1965, when Che fi rst promised Antônio Agostinho Neto the leader of the liberation movement fighting the Portuguese co-lonial rulers of Angola that Cuba would assist the liberation struggle in his country, and May 1991, when the last Cuban combatants left An-gola, some 450,000 Cubans (7% of the Cuban population) had served in this worn-torn country (Harris 2009). They helped the liberation move-ment gain Angola’s independence and then helped the new government of President Neto defeat two South African military interventions and a bloody insurgency backed by the U.S. government. They also helped the Angolan government repulse an invasion from Zaire (now the Dem-ocratic Republic of the Congo) in the longest and largest military cam-paign in Africa since World War II.<p></p><p></p>Cuban support played a key role in Angola’s liberation and defense and in the liberation of Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde from Portuguese<p></p> 
THE SECRET MISSION IN AFRICA	141
<p></p>colonial domination, and Cuba also helped defend the newly indepen-dent government of the Congo Republic (Brazzaville), formerly a French colony, from neocolonial forces intent on overturning it. They played an important role in the liberation of Mozambique from Portuguese co-lonial rule, as well as the liberation of the white-settler-controlled for-mer British colony of Rhodesia (Zimbabwe). Moreover, the Cuban military victories against the white South African forces in Angola greatly contributed to the liberation of Namibia and to the ultimate downfall of the white supremacist apartheid regime in South Africa it-self. This regime was greatly weakened by the demoralizing defeat the combined Cuban, Angolan, and Namibian forces inflicted on the white South African troops in Angola and Namibia.<p></p><p></p>Nelson Mandela, the fi rst president of the new Republic of South Africa, established after the downfall of the racist apartheid regime in that country, is among the many African leaders who have praised the Cubans for the assistance they provided in these struggles for indepen-dence. He has repeatedly thanked the Cubans for their contribution to the victory of his people over racist domination and imperialism. For example, at the public opening of the Southern Africa–Cuba Solidarity Conference in 1995, President Mandela (1995) said:<p></p><p></p>Cubans came to our region as doctors, teachers, soldiers, agricul-tural experts, but never as colonizers. They have shared the same trenches with us in the struggle against colonialism, underdevelop-ment, and apartheid. Hundreds of Cubans have given their lives, literally, in a struggle that was, first and foremost, not theirs but ours. As Southern Africans we salute them. We vow never to forget this unparalleled example of selfless internationalism.<p></p><p></p>At a more individual level, Che’s brief presence in the Congo changed dramatically the life of the Congolese teenager who served as his trans-lator during the months he and his companions operated in the Fizi Baraka mountain range near the border between the Congo and Tan-zania. Freddy Ilanga, who spoke both Swahili and French, had been a newspaper vendor and was just 16 years old when he was assigned by the rebel leadership to serve as Che’s translator during the time he and his Cuban comrades carried out their then secret mission of providing<p></p> 
142	CHE GUEVARA<p></p><p></p>support to the Congolese rebels. Freddy Ilanga’s brief encounter with the legendary Che and his Cuban companions placed him on the path of an incredible journey that took him from being a teenage rebel in the eastern Congo to Cuba where he studied medicine, married a Cuban woman, and became a brain surgeon.<p></p>As a young African who saw the whites in his country as racist op-pressors, he knew nothing about the Cuban Revolution and at fi rst he considered Che to be a sarcastic white man (Doyle 2004). But he soon came to admire Che. He was particularly impressed with how Che treated the Africans around him with respect. In those days in the Congo, this was something Freddy had never seen.<p></p><p></p>Shortly before Che and his companions pulled out of the Congo, they arranged for Freddy to be sent to Cuba, where he finished his schooling, went to the university to become a doctor, and then specialized in pedi-atric neurosurgery. Although Freddy never returned to the Congo before he died in Cuba, today in Africa there are hundreds of Cuban doctors and African doctors who were trained in Cuba (Harris 2009).<p></p><p></p>Ironically, Kabila seized control of the government of the Congo in 1997, at the head of a military force that originated in the same region of the country where Che and his Cuban comrades had established their training base in 1965. Backed by the governments of Rwanda and Uganda, Kabila’s forces managed to topple the long-time dictato-rial regime of General Mobutu Sese Seko, the U.S.-backed military strongman who had seized power in November 1965, the same month Che and his men were forced to abandon their mission in the Congo. Kabila was assassinated by a member of his own staff in an unsuccess-ful coup attempt in 2001, and his son replaced him as the Congolese head of state.<p></p><p></p><p></p>CHE’S SECRET RETURN TO CUBA IN 1966<p></p><p></p>In November 1965, Che left the Congo as secretly as he had entered seven months earlier. After leaving the Congo, he spent a couple of months in secrecy in the Cuban embassy in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Dur-ing this time, Castro gave Che’s wife, Aleida, permission to visit him, and she arrived in Tanzania in mid-January 1966 (March 2008:200). For Aleida, this visit was what she had dreamed might happen some day. It<p></p> 
THE SECRET MISSION IN AFRICA	143
<p></p>enabled them to be completely alone together without their children and the constant circle of subordinates and comrades that had previously sur-rounded him in Cuba.<p></p>During their stay in the Cuban embassy in Dar es Salaam, they slept, ate, read, and conversed in a large dining room that was converted into living quarters for them. During this time, Che went over the notes he had written during his seven months in the Congo and wrote a lengthy manuscript that was primarily intended as a report for Cuba’s top leaders on the failure of his mission and what he had learned about the possi-bilities for assisting liberation movements and leftist governments in Africa.<p></p><p></p>This manuscript was read by Fidel Castro and a few other key officials of the Cuban government but kept secret for more than 30 years. As in the case of his Bolivian diary, Aleida March played a central role in its publication. It was published in English with the title The African Dream: The Diaries of the Revolutionary War in the Congo, with the addi-tion of an introduction written by the well-known British journalist and historian Richard Gott (2000).<p></p><p></p>In Castro’s 1987 interview with the Italian journalist mentioned above, he revealed what happened after Che was forced to withdraw from the Congo (Deutschmann 1994:119). According to Castro:<p></p><p></p>Having now spent about six months in Zaire, Che stayed for a while in Tanzania, assessing the experience he had just lived through. His conduct on the mission was, as always, exemplary to the highest degree. His stay in Africa was temporary, awaiting the creation of conditions for traveling to South America.<p></p><p></p>But as Castro explained in this interview, Che’s situation was now greatly complicated by the fact that during his absence his resignation letter had been made public by the Cuban government in response to the grow-ing rumors and outrageous stories circulating about his mysterious disap-pearance from public view in Cuba. To quote Castro (pages 119–20):<p></p><p></p>Once the letter had been made public—politically it had become unavoidable to publish it—Che, with his particular character, felt very awkward about returning to Cuba after having said farewell.<p></p> 
144	CHE GUEVARA<p></p><p></p>But in the end, I persuaded him to return, because it was the best move given all the practical matters he wanted to take care of. So, he secretly returned to Cuba. He stayed several months, training in a remote mountain region . . . with those who were to accompany him [to Bolivia].<p></p><p></p>It was a bitter blow for him to return secretly to Cuba after spending seven months in the Congo without having anything to show for his efforts and after having resigned his important positions in the Cuban government. The experience, however, seems to have made Che more determined than ever to undertake a successful revolutionary mission outside of Cuba, but this time in his native South America.<p></p><p></p>Upon his return to Cuba from the Congo, Che found solace in the fact that one of his grandest dreams had come true; an intercontinental or-ganization representing the underdeveloped countries of the world, with its headquarters in Cuba, had been founded only a few months before his return by Fidel Castro. From January 3 to 15, 1966, the fi rst con-ference of the Organization of Solidarity of Asian, African, and Latin American Peoples—referred to thereafter as the Tricontinental—was held in Havana, with some 400 delegates from the underdeveloped world attending. As it turned out, Che’s revolutionary ideas were the central topic of discussion among the delegates, and this undoubtedly re-inforced his determination to carry out the realization of one of his old-est dreams: the liberation of Latin America’s oppressed and exploited masses. This dream was bolstered by his belief that Cuba would become truly independent of the Soviet Union only when additional revolu-tionary governments were established in Latin America that could pro-vide support to Cuba.<p></p><p></p>Che’s return to Cuba was never made public (Deutschmann 1994:119). He remained in hiding during the entire period that he stayed there. Almost immediately after his return, he began to prepare a new mission that he felt would not have the limitations of the abortive undertaking in the Congo. He chose Bolivia as the site for a revolutionary guerrilla foco, which he himself would organize and lead. In October 1966, he once again left Cuba, as secretly as he had entered, to begin this undertaking.<p></p> 
<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Chapter 9<p></p><p></p>CHE’S FINAL MISSION<p></p><p></p>IN BOLIVIA<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Che’s fi nal mission was carried out in Bolivia, in the heart of South America. Bolivia is a starkly beautiful country that combines towering snow-capped mountains and a high-altitude, windswept, treeless dry pla-teau with deep tropical valleys and a wide expanse of tropical lowlands in the eastern portion of the country that borders Brazil. The country is divided into two distinctive parts by the massive wall of the Andes Mountains, which traverse the country from north to south. The moun-tains and high plateau in the western portion of the country have such an otherworldly terrain and such unusual colors that they look more like Nepal or the alternate reality of another planet than a country in the heart of the South American continent near the equator. This part of the country contains the altiplano, the great high plateau of the South American continent. Here the descendants of the ancient Incan civili-zation, with their herds of llamas, live an impoverished existence some two and a half miles above sea level. The vastness and barrenness of this windy plateau give it a haunting beauty all its own, and anyone who has been to this part of the world carries away unforgettable memories of magnifi cent panoramas, azure blue skies fi lled with white puffy clouds<p></p> 
146	CHE GUEVARA<p></p><p></p>that look close enough to touch, and snow-covered peaks bathed in the soft, multicolored glow of an indescribably beautiful sunset.<p></p>On the altiplano are Bolivia’s major mining centers and the focal point of national politics, the capital city of La Paz. Situated at 11,900 feet in a deep basin on the altiplano, La Paz is the highest capital city in the world. The approach by land to the city is from the altiplano. Consequently, the first view one receives of La Paz is from some 2,000 feet directly above it. The view of the shiny tin-roofed city in the basin below takes one’s breath away. Far below sprawls the glittering city and, in the distance beyond, the snowy peaks of the mystical Mount Illimani (sacred to the Incas) tower to a height of over 21,000 feet.<p></p><p></p>La Paz is a fascinating blend of the old and new. Together with mod-ern buildings and late-model cars, one sees churches built by the Span-iards over four centuries ago; and in every street, Indian women with their characteristic bowler hats, colorful shawls, and babies carried on their backs. It is a bustling, sunny city, fi lled with color, lots of hilly streets, Spanish colonial style buildings, and an atmosphere of excite-ment and activity. It has a breezy, cool, and dry climate, and because it is so high the atmosphere is thin and it is easy to lose one’s breath without too much exertion.<p></p><p></p>Over the mountains from La Paz lies the city of Cochabamba, an important agricultural center in the heart of an 8,400-foot-high valley where the climate is temperate and the soil quite fertile. Farther east, the mountains drop toward the tropical savannas and plains of eastern Bolivia. The most important city in this area is Santa Cruz, located at the foot of the eastern slopes of the Andes. Santa Cruz is known for its colonial Spanish architecture and its beautiful women of Spanish de-scent, but today it has all the characteristics of a boom city. The grow-ing economy of the area is based on sugar, cotton, rice, oil, and cocaine (it was rumored in the 1980s and 1990s to be the capital of Bolivia’s international cocaine trade). Approximately 200 miles south of Santa Cruz lies the town of Camiri, the only other sizable urban center in the eastern part of the country. Camiri is Bolivia’s oil and gas center, and although it is not comparable to Santa Cruz in either importance or size, it too has experienced an economic boom.<p></p><p></p>Despite the eastern portion of Bolivia accounting for approximately<p></p><p></p>70 percent of the total land area of the country, only about one-fourth<p></p> 
CHE’S FINAL MISSION IN BOLIVIA	147
<p></p>of Bolivia’s small population lives east of the Andes (the population of Bolivia was approximately 4 million in 1967 when Che and his guer-rilla force were there and today it is over 9 million). The real heartland of Bolivia is located on the altiplano. It is there the vast majority of the country’s population live and there the main loci of economic and po-litical power are to be found. Moreover, most of the important events in Bolivian political history have taken place on the altiplano.<p></p><p></p>Before choosing Bolivia as the site of his guerrilla operation, Che considered several other countries, particularly Argentina and Peru. There was nothing he would have liked better than to bring the revo-lution to his native Argentina. This was something he had planned for many years. But it was obvious the situation in Argentina was not fa-vorable for such an undertaking in 1966. In 1964, a Cuban-backed and Guevara-inspired guerrilla force attempted to establish itself in north-ern Argentina, but the effort ended in total failure a few months later without having realized a single military engagement (Castañeda 1997: 247–50). The leader of this group was the Argentine Jorge Masetti, who was a close friend of Che’s in Cuba. Together they had planned the Argentine operation in early 1963. Their objective at the time was to establish a chain of guerrilla focos from northern Argentina to Peru.<p></p><p></p>However, Masetti’s small force was defeated by the harsh environ-ment of northern Argentina, where his group tried to establish a guer-rilla foco, their poor organization, and their inability to attract any popular support. In the end, those members of his guerrilla band who did not die from starvation and exposure were either taken prisoner or killed by the Argentine police and armed forces. The death of Masetti and the three Cuban comrades from Guevara’s own bodyguard who had gone with Masetti to help establish the guerrilla foco in Argentina was a bitter reminder to Che that Argentina was not the most suitable place for him to establish an armed revolutionary movement in 1966.<p></p><p></p>As for Peru, the situation there was not any more favorable than in Argentina. In 1966 that country had an elected civilian government with a moderately progressive program (Taibo 1996:612–16). Moreover, the government and the army had effectively suppressed several guerrilla uprisings in isolated parts of the country during the preceding two years. Che also considered Colombia, Venezuela, and Brazil, but never very seriously (Anderson 1997:678). In the end, Bolivia was chosen because<p></p> 
148	CHE GUEVARA<p></p><p></p>it was considered to have the best revolutionary potential and because it afforded the ideal strategic location. It was in the center of the conti-nent and bordered Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, and Peru.<p></p>Che had been in Bolivia for a short time in 1953, when he had trav-eled there with his friend Carlos “Calica” Ferrer, and his impression of the country at that time undoubtedly infl uenced his choice of Bolivia in 1966. As previously mentioned in chapter 3, he was there during a period when the country was literally infected with revolutionary en-thusiasm. Less than a year before, thousands of miners, peasants, and deserters from the Bolivian army had revolted and brought down the then existing military regime. When Che arrived in La Paz in 1953, the old army had been disbanded, the largest foreign-owned mines in the coun-try had been nationalized, and the peasants had taken possession of many of the large landed estates following the enactment of the new government’s agrarian reform law. The streets were fi lled with singing and loud demonstrations, and everywhere he saw the armed peasants and workers of the revolutionary militia. He surely must have thought of these armed peasants and workers in 1966 when he chose Bolivia as the place to initiate his revolutionary movement, since he fi rmly believed the revolution of those days had been subsequently betrayed by oppor-tunistic politicians and army generals corrupted by Yanqui dollars, U.S. military advisers, and the CIA.<p></p><p></p>Most of Che’s information on Bolivia appears to have come from sev-eral Bolivian Communists, who had helped previously with the Masetti operation, and from Che’s aide, José María Martínez Tamayo (Papi) who was sent to Bolivia in March 1966 to make the preliminary preparations for Che’s new operation (Castañeda 1997:334). Most of these Bolivian Communists had received military training in Cuba. They assured Papi the country was ripe for a Cuban-type revolution and all that was needed was Cuban support. They informed him there was widespread discontent in Bolivia with the military-backed regime of President Barrientos, and they contended this government could fall at any moment. They also spoke of the country’s strong revolutionary tradition, of the visible and often resented U.S.-dominant presence in the country’s economic and political affairs, and of how the mining centers were virtual caldrons of rebellion. Finally, they confirmed what Che and the Cuban intelligence service already knew, that the Bolivian security and military forces were perhaps the most ineffective and badly organized in Latin America.<p></p> 
CHE’S FINAL MISSION IN BOLIVIA	149
<p></p>As a result, Che decided Bolivia was the appropriate location for his operation. He minimized the fact that Bolivia’s Communists were badly split along pro-Soviet and pro-Chinese lines and the leader of Bolivia’s pro-Soviet Communist Party, Mario Monje, had told Castro during the Tricontinental conference in 1966 he was interested himself in estab-lishing a guerrilla foco in Bolivia.<p></p><p></p>Bolivia had great strategic importance for Che since it is the corazón (heart) of South America and borders most of the major countries on the continent. From Bolivia, Che hoped his revolutionary effort would extend in every direction and involve all of South America. The ex-pedition to Bolivia was designed to create a guerrilla madre, or mother base, that would provide training and a jumping-off point for a series of<p></p><p></p>

150	CHE GUEVARA<p></p><p></p>revolutionary guerrilla forces that would engulf the entire continent in a revolutionary struggle for a unified and socialist Latin America (Siles del Valle 1996:29–38).<p></p>Once he had decided on Bolivia, Che selected the southeast of the country for his initial guerrilla foco. He chose the southeast because it of-fered relatively close access to neighboring Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Paraguay. In addition, he assumed that in this area, because of its isola-tion and sparse population, his guerrilla force would be able to develop without being discovered before it was ready to begin operations. This region of the country is part of the Gran Chaco region, which stretches into Paraguay. Its climate is semiarid to semi-tropical and has only two seasons: summer and winter. There are rain and hot, humid conditions during the summer months from December through March, but the win-ter months from April through November consist of dry, hot days and cool nights, when the temperature can drop below freezing. Median tem-peratures vary from 73 to 83 degrees F (23 to 28 degrees C), but this region can have the hottest days in Bolivia. When the humidity is low the dry heat can reach extreme temperatures, up to 115 degrees F (46 de-grees C) during the daytime.<p></p><p></p>The specific location chosen as the central base of operations for Che’s group was the Ñancahuazú River valley. In this semi-tropical, scrub-forested valley, Che planned to train the nucleus of his guerrilla move-ment, build fortifications, and establish caches of supplies and arms. Once his force was ready for combat, he planned to move north and threaten three of Bolivia’s major cities: Cochabamba, Santa Cruz, and Sucre. This would enable the guerrillas to control the railway line that runs from northern Argentina to Santa Cruz, as well as to cut the U.S.-owned Gulf Oil Company pipeline that ran from Santa Cruz to Camiri. Later, Che planned to locate a second guerrilla base farther east, on the slopes of the Andes.<p></p><p></p>Che planned to begin military operations in May 1967, following six months of preparation. In the opening phase, he planned to divide his force into several small bands and have them strike simultaneously at widely dispersed points north of the Ñancahuazú area. In this way he hoped to force the Bolivian army to disperse its forces over a large area, while his guerrillas made a slow withdrawal toward the Ñancahuazú River valley, where they could rely on previously established caches<p></p> 
CHE’S FINAL MISSION IN BOLIVIA	151
<p></p>of supplies and fortifi cations. Che reasoned that if the inexperienced Bolivian army attempted to follow the guerrillas into the Ñancahuazú River valley, they would be at the mercy of these guerrilla bands. As his guerrillas demonstrated their capacity to win victories against the Bolivian army, Che believed many of the country’s peasants and miners would come to the support of the movement.<p></p><p></p>Che also assumed that once his guerrilla movement was well estab-lished and drawing widespread support and public attention, conditions would become more favorable for guerrilla operations in Peru and Ar-gentina (Taibo 1996:615). He planned to have a guerrilla group oper-ating in the Ayacucho region of Peru by the end of 1967 and another force in northern Argentina sometime after that. The Bolivian base of operations was to be a training ground for the nucleus of both the Peru-vian and Argentine forces.<p></p><p></p>Che revealed his overall strategy in the message he sent to the sec-ond conference of the Tricontinental in 1967. It was entitled: “Create Two, Three, Many Vietnams.” In this message, it is clear he believed a successful guerrilla insurgency in Latin America would force the United States to commit itself directly to the contest, creating a second Vietnam in the heart of South America. His conception of the course of events that would follow the appearance of his guerrilla movement in Bolivia is revealed in the following passage from his message to the conference:<p></p><p></p>New outbreaks of war will appear in these and other Latin American countries, as has already occurred in Bolivia. And they will con-tinue to grow, with all the vicissitudes involved in this dangerous occupation of the modern revolutionist.

It is the road that other people will follow, and it is the road that Latin America will follow. . . . We must definitely keep in mind that imperialism is a world system, the final stage of capitalism, and that it must be beaten in a great worldwide confrontation. (Deutschmann 1997:322–23)<p></p><p></p>From this message, it is clear Che was counting on U.S involvement in Bolivia and he saw this as a means of gaining the support of both Boliv-ian and international public opinion.<p></p>As for the ultimate goal of the continental revolutionary movement Che was hoping to start in Bolivia, this too was revealed in his message to the Tricontinental conference. He said:<p></p><p></p>We can summarize our hopes for victory as follows: the destruction of imperialism through the elimination of its strongest bulwark: the imperial dominion of the United States of North America. This will be accomplished through the gradual liberation of its subject peoples, either one by one or by groups, drawing the enemy into a diffi cult struggle outside of its territory; and cutting it off from its bases of support, i.e., its dependent territories.<p></p><p></p>Thus, for Che, Bolivia was to be the first step in a grand plan to liberate all of Latin America from U.S. infl uence and convert it into a bastion of socialism and anti-imperialism. Everything, therefore, depended on successfully establishing in Bolivia a guerrilla madre that would develop into a successful revolutionary movement of continental dimensions.<p></p><p></p>Prophetically, however, the final sentences in his message to the Tri-continental Conference suggested what was to come:<p></p><p></p>Wherever death may surprise us, let it be welcome if our battle cry has reached even one receptive ear; if another hand reaches out to take up our arms, and other men come forward to join in our funeral dirge with the rattling of machine guns and with new cries of battle and victory.<p></p><p></p>Death did surprise Che in Bolivia, and his battle cry has reached many receptive ears over the years since then.<p></p> 
CHE’S FINAL MISSION IN BOLIVIA	153
<p></p>Che could not seek the support of the pro-Chinese Communists in Bolivia because the leaders of the rival pro-Soviet Communists in Bo-livia had told Fidel Castro their party planned to set up a guerrilla foco in the country. It appears these leaders purposely misled Castro into believing they were going to do this in order to outfl ank the more militant, pro-Chinese Communists, who they were afraid were interested in doing this with Cuban help (Anderson:682–87). Che was aware of this political situation, and he distrusted Monje and the other leaders of Bolivia’s pro-Soviet Communist Party. Consequently, he relied primarily on a small number of pro-Cuba supporters within Monje’s pro-Soviet Communist party to make the preliminary preparations for his guerrilla operation. These were individuals who had previously spent some time training in Cuba, and Che knew many of them personally. He felt they could be trusted to lay the groundwork for his operation without telling even the leadership of their party what they were doing.<p></p><p></p>The most important of Che’s Bolivian contacts were two brothers— Roberto “Coco” and Guido “Inti” Peredo. These two brothers helped convince Che that Bolivia was the ideal base for a guerrilla operation. Because of this and perhaps because Che saw these two brothers as the future Raúl and Fidel Castro of Bolivia, he entrusted them with the most important aspects of the preliminary preparations for his guerrilla foco.<p></p><p></p>Coco and Inti had participated in the efforts that were made in 1960 to establish guerrilla focos in Salta, Argentina, and Puerto Maldonado, Peru. They had joined the Communist Party’s youth wing at an early age and their previous efforts to establish Cuban-style guerrilla focos made them ideal candidates for the guerrilla force Che organized in Bo-livia. They also owned and operated a taxi in La Paz. This vocation gave them a perfect cover for their clandestine activities. Sometime dur-ing the summer of 1966, they both traveled to the southeast and lo-cated themselves in Camiri, Bolivia’s petroleum center. There they made friends with some of the local inhabitants and let it be known they were interested in buying land in the area north of Camiri for the purpose of establishing a ranch and cereal farm.<p></p><p></p>In September they succeeded in buying an abandoned ranch in a largely uninhabited region near the Ñancahuazú River, 50 miles north of Camiri. In addition, they rented some adjacent property from their only neighbor, Ciro Argañaraz, a local landowner and cattle rancher.<p></p> 
154	CHE GUEVARA<p></p><p></p>While Inti returned to La Paz to take care of their personal affairs, Coco began readying the ranch for the arrival of Che and his Cuban com-rades. He contracted two local men to work the ranch and planted several different varieties of cereals. He also bought some cattle, hogs, and poultry. During this period, Coco traveled the winding dirt road from the ranch to Camiri in his new Toyota jeep almost daily. On this road, about 12 miles from the ranch, is the small village of Lagunillas. Coco stopped there on several occasions to buy vegetables and fruit. The large amounts of supplies he transported to the ranch in his jeep aroused the suspicion of many of the local villagers. Many of them, as well as the landowner, Argañaraz, assumed the Peredo brothers were cocaine merchants or cattle thieves.<p></p><p></p>Meanwhile, in La Paz, Che’s other Bolivian collaborators made ar-rangements for receiving Che’s group and their equipment. They ob-tained a house and a warehouse in the center of the city, where they stored arms and ammunition, which they received hidden in bags of cement mix. These were shipped from Cuba to the port of Arica in northern Chile and from there sent by rail to La Paz.<p></p><p></p>One of Che’s prime contacts in La Paz during this period, and later the only female member of his guerrilla force, was a woman known by the code name of Tania. Her real name was Haydée Tamara Bunke. She was a German Argentine Che had met in Communist East Germany and who had come to Cuba on the invitation of Che. While there, she be-came a member of the small circle of Argentines who met frequently at Che’s house. Tania left Cuba and entered Bolivia in 1964 with a false Ar-gentine passport. In early 1965 she obtained a job working for Gonzalo López, director of information in the presidential palace. In addition to working for López, Tania also successfully passed herself off as a professor of languages. This gave her an opportunity to travel widely throughout the country, ostensibly for the purpose of studying the languages and folk songs of the indigenous (Indian) population. In her spare time she worked her way into some of the capital’s artistic, cultural, and diplo-matic circles. Her contacts provided Che with valuable information and assistance. Through her direct access to documents and forms in the In-formation Office of the Presidency she was later able to provide Che and some of his Cuban companions with very impressive credentials that allowed them to travel quite freely within the country.<p></p> 
CHE’S FINAL MISSION IN BOLIVIA	155
<p></p>Che arrived in Bolivia, around November 1, 1966, on a plane from São Paolo, Brazil. He entered Bolivia as a clean-shaven, bald man wear-ing glasses. He had two false Uruguayan passports, and it is not clear which of the two he actually used to enter Bolivia. The passports were issued under the names of Ramón Benitez and Adolfo Mena. The fin-gerprints on both passports are exactly the same as those that were later identified by various governments as belonging to Che. The photographs on both passports are also the same. On close examination they reveal a clean-shaven, bald Che Guevara wearing glasses. Both passports have the same dates of entry and departure from Madrid airport.<p></p><p></p>Che was accompanied by one of his longtime Cuban comrades: Alberto Fernández (whose code name was Pacho). Upon arrival they contacted Tania, and she gave Che a truly extraordinary document: it accredited Che (Adolfo Mena in this case) as a special envoy of the Or-ganization of American States. According to this document, he was in Bolivia to conduct research on the social and economic relations prevail-ing in the rural areas of Bolivia.<p></p><p></p>With Che carrying this document, Che and Pacho traveled to the Ñancahuazú ranch in two separate jeeps, arriving there the night of No-vember 6. Che brought to Bolivia a contingent of 12 Cubans. Most of the members of this handpicked group were veterans of Che’s guerrilla<p></p><p></p>

Many of them had served in important posts in the Cuban government and armed forces, and several were members of the Central Committee of the Cuban Communist Party. All of these individuals were tied to Che by unquestioning personal loyalty. Some had been with him in the Congo. They were willing to follow him to hell if he asked them to do so, and in the end only three of them returned home to Cuba alive.<p></p><p></p>The Bolivian members of the guerrilla force were largely recruited by Coco and two other Bolivian agents, known by the code names of Ro-dolfo and Sánchez. The latter two men also served as liaisons between Che’s group and the support network in the urban areas during the period before Che’s guerrilla force was discovered. The entry in Che’s diary at the end of November 1966 reveals he hoped to increase the number of Bolivians in his force to at least 20 before beginning military operations.<p></p><p></p>In December at the Ñancahuazú ranch he met with Mario Monje, the leader of the pro-Soviet Bolivian Communist Party, to discuss the pos-sibility of receiving men and assistance from his party. However, Monje refused to support the guerrilla operation and send men unless he was in charge of it. He made it clear his party could not offi cially support the guerrilla operation. However, he offered to resign from the party, obtain at least its neutrality, and bring several cadres of men to join those already in training, provided Che agreed to give him both the po-litical and military command of the entire operation and a free hand to seek the support of the Communist parties in the other South American countries where Che planned to extend his guerrilla movement.<p></p><p></p>Monje’s conditions for supporting the guerrilla movement were to-tally unacceptable to Che. He told Monje he could accept no conditions concerning his leadership of the military operations. He knew, in the kind of revolutionary struggle he was planning, the military leadership of the struggle would have to come from the guerrilla force itself, not from a politician or group of politicians hundreds of miles from the scene of battle. Nor was he about to turn over the command of a movement that, in its final phase, would engulf all of Latin America to someone he considered lacked both the proper revolutionary vision as well as the necessary military experience. As for Monje’s resigning from his position as leader of the party, Che said he considered this a tremendous<p></p> 
CHE’S FINAL MISSION IN BOLIVIA	157
<p></p>error, since it would accommodate those in his party who should be publicly condemned for their hypocrisy.<p></p>Che’s experience in the Congo also led him to reject Monje’s condi-tions. The poor leadership of the Congolese rebels provided by their leaders such as Laurent Kabila was certainly on his mind and his experi-ence in the Congo made him all the more determined to keep control over both the political and military direction of the guerrilla force in Bolivia rather than relinquish it to weak and untrustworthy local politi-cal leaders such as Monje (Guevara 2000:x–xi).<p></p><p></p>Monje met with the Bolivians in Che’s group and told them they could stay with Che and be expelled from the party, or they could sup-port the party and return with him to La Paz. Much to Monje’s surprise, all the Bolivians present said they preferred to stay with Che. The next morning, Monje announced he was leaving for La Paz. Che realized Monje had disagreed with him over who should command the move-ment as a pretext to escape any responsibility for cooperating with Che’s group. Che appears to have seen through Monje’s subterfuge at the time; he noted in his diary that Monje had discovered from Coco that he (Che) would not compromise on the crucial question of who was to lead the movement. Che realized Monje had disagreed with him over who should command the movement so that he would have an excuse to not support Che’s group.<p></p><p></p>If Monje had accepted the political leadership of the movement (while deferring to Che’s military leadership) and had sent members of his party to fight with Che’s nuclear group, then the guerrilla operation might not have suffered later from the stigma of being directed and organized by foreigners. After Che’s guerrilla force was discovered and it became known it was led by Che and a group of Cubans, the Boliv-ian government was able to argue convincingly that the guerrillas were foreigners intervening in the domestic affairs of the country.<p></p><p></p>By the end of March 1967, Che had succeeded in recruiting ap-proximately 20 Bolivians. Some had trained like Coco and Inti in Cuba specifi cally for fi ghting in the guerrilla operation. The remainder were dissident members of the youth wing of Monje’s party and unemployed miners from the tin-mining areas on Bolivia’s high plateau.<p></p><p></p>The unemployed miners were recruited by Moisés Guevara (no rela-tion to Che), an important union leader among the leftist tin miners in<p></p> 
158	CHE GUEVARA<p></p><p></p>Oruro. Moisés had broken away from the pro-Chinese Communist Party in Bolivia and had traveled several times to Cuba, where he had met Che. Although Monje was opposed to involving Moisés in the guer-rilla force, Che’s Bolivian contacts invited Moisés to join the force with some of his miners. Moisés agreed and brought eight men with him to the Ñancahuazú camp in February 1967.<p></p><p></p>In addition to the Cubans and the Bolivians, Che’s guerrilla force in-cluded among its members three Peruvians known by the code names of El Chino, Negro, and Eustaquio, respectively. El Chino (Juan Pablo Chang, who was a Peruvian of Chinese descent) was supposed to estab-lish Che’s planned guerrilla foco in Peru. He brought Eustaquio, a radio operator, and Negro, a physician, to Che’s camp during the latter part of February. They were to be joined later by an additional number of Peru-vians who were to train with Che’s force and then return to their country to start another guerrilla foco there.<p></p><p></p>The total number of combatants in the guerrilla force stood at 39 when the first encounter between the army and Che’s group took place on March 23, 1967. Most of the leadership positions were held by Cu-bans. Che appointed his old comrade in arms from the Sierra Maestra Comandante Juan Vitalio Acuña (code name Joaquín) as his second in command of the guerrilla force and also leader of the rearguard. He also appointed Cubans to the posts of leader of the vanguard, chief of operations, chief of services, and chief of supplies. Inti and Coco were the only two Bolivians entrusted with any leadership responsibilities. Inti was placed in charge of fi nances and appointed political commis-sar to the Bolivians. Coco, who was initially placed in charge of urban contacts and recruitment, was later incorporated into the guerrilla force and assigned various responsibilities.<p></p><p></p>No additions to the guerrilla force took place after the outbreak of hostilities in late March. Instead, the size of Che’s force was steadily reduced as each encounter with the army took its toll. Che had hoped to recruit peasants from the local area once his force began operations, but he failed to recruit even a single peasant after the fi ghting began.<p></p>Che’s original plan was to begin military operations north of the Rio Grande and then slowly withdraw southward across a terrain carefully prepared with caches of arms and ammunition, food supplies, and forti-fi ed bases. He needed perhaps another month before this plan would<p></p> 
CHE’S FINAL MISSION IN BOLIVIA	159
<p></p>have been ready to be put into operation. But he had to discard it when the army discovered his main base after receiving credible reports about the presence of guerrillas in the Ñancahuazú area during the fi rst few weeks of March.<p></p>On the morning of March 11, two of Moisés Guevara’s new recruits left the main camp, ostensibly to go hunting. They took the path leading down to the river, but instead of going to the east, where the best hunt-ing area was, they disappeared in the direction of Camiri. A few days later, they were arrested and brought to the headquarters of the Fourth Army Division in Camiri. There they gave their captors a detailed re-port concerning all they knew about the guerrilla operation. They gave the army detailed information about the location of the guerrillas’ camp, the number of people there, and most of the guerrilla force being away at the time on a training and reconnaissance march to the north. They said they had been told Che Guevara was the leader of the operation and he was with the others in the north.<p></p><p></p>The information these two deserters and several local people gave the Bolivian authorities led to the discovery and subsequent annihila-tion of Che’s guerrilla force. This information enabled the army to lo-cate Che’s main base before he and his men were ready to begin military operations. It also gave the army the initiative from the beginning of the confl ict until its tragic termination some six months later. Timing was a crucial factor in Che’s strategy, and the premature initiation of hostilities threw his whole operation off balance. His small force of men was never really able to recover from the shock of having their central base discovered before they were ready to begin fi ghting. All of Che’s subsequent efforts were little more than futile, though valiant, attempts to put up a good fight in the face of overwhelming odds. He and his men seem to have deluded themselves during the first few months of fighting into believing their operation still could succeed, but in reality their fate was sealed from the beginning. It was just a matter of time before they were caught or killed.<p></p><p></p>Che had written of the extreme danger a guerrilla force faces dur-ing its preparatory stage in “Guerrilla Warfare: A Method.” He pointed out that the future of a revolutionary movement depends on how the nuclear guerrilla force handles itself when the enemy first moves against it. According to Che, unless the guerrillas are able to develop their<p></p>

He had origi-nally planned to have his force operate across a zone carefully prepared with caches of supplies and fortifi ed bases, but the army’s discovery of their main base forced Che and his men to move into an area about which they knew very little and where they had difficulty finding food and places to hide.<p></p><p></p>Only Che’s will to succeed and his refusal to accept defeat can ex-plain his optimism about the future of his guerrilla operation after the discovery of his force at the end of March. Anyone else undoubtedly would have concluded under the circumstances there was no choice but to abandon the entire venture and escape while it was still possible to do so. But not Che; until the end he continued to believe his effort would succeed. Perhaps he kept thinking of how high the odds had been against the success of Castro’s operation after the Granma disaster, when only 12 members of the original 80-man invasion force survived the landing on Cuban soil and made their way to the Sierra Maestra.<p></p>

(The information in this chapter relies heavily upon the author’s original research; see Harris 2007:143–67.) However, they suffered steady losses and Che grew increasingly ill since he had no med-icine to treat his frequent severe asthma attacks. At the end of August, the guerrilla column under Joaquín (Che’s Cuban comrade Coman-dante Juan Vitalio Acuña Nuñez) was ambushed and all but one mem-ber of the column were killed by the army. Among the losses was the guerrilla force’s only female member, Tania (Tamara Bunke). By the middle of September, the remaining column under Che’s command was being encircled by an increasing number of troops, and the news of the army’s successful encounters in late September with his column near La Higuera, a small hamlet of about 100 inhabitants 90 miles Southwest of the city of Santa Cruz, was received by the military high command and the government of President Barrientos as a clear sign victory was almost within their grasp. In Vallegrande, the main town in this area, the new Second Manchego Ranger Regiment had just arrived after<p></p> 
162	CHE GUEVARA<p></p><p></p>fi nishing 19 weeks of special counterinsurgency training from U.S. Army Special Forces personnel. By dawn on September 27, the first units of this new regiment had moved into the region around La Higuera. A unit of these U.S.-trained Rangers captured one of the Bolivian members of Che’s guerrillas force who was code-named Camba (his real name was Orlando Jiménez Bazán) and was able to interrogate another Bolivian member of Che’s column named León (Antonio Rodríguez Flores), who had deserted the guerrilla force and turned himself over to the army fol-lowing a particularly bloody engagement in which several members of Che’s force were killed.<p></p>In his diary, Che acknowledged his losses were very great in the La Higuera area, particularly the death of three of his best comrades. He considered the loss of his Bolivian lieutenant Coco (Roberto Peredo Leigue, who had been trained in Cuba and Vietnam) the most grievous loss. In addition, he noted in his diary that his Cuban comrade Miguel (Manuel Hernández, who had been with him since 1958) and the Boliv-ian doctor with the code name Julio (Mario Gutierrez Ardaya) had been magnificent fighters and the human value of all three was inexpressible. His diary also reveals that the last days of September were extremely tense ones for him and his men. They were forced to move by night and hide during the day, and on more than one occasion they were nearly discov-ered by the soldiers who were searching for them.<p></p><p></p>By the end of the month, it was clear to everyone in Che’s small force they were in a desperate position. A circle of troops was closing in around them, and their every move was being reported to the army by the local population. Their tragic plight was summed up cryptically by Che in his diary: “Our conditions are the same as last month, except now the army is demonstrating increasing effectiveness in its actions and the campesi-nos are giving us no support and have turned into informers.”<p></p><p></p>Nevertheless, Che still believed they could continue their mission. Thus, he noted in his diary: “The most important task is to escape and look for more propitious zones; and then afterwards our contacts, in spite of the fact that the whole apparatus is disrupted in La Paz where they have given us severe blows.” In view of the circumstances, however, Che and his comrades had little chance “to escape and look for more propitious zones.” They were completely surrounded by thousands of troops and un-<p></p>

On the evening of October 3, Che heard a news broadcast con-cerning Camba and León, and he made the following entry in his diary: “Both gave abundant information about Fernando [Che’s own code name], his illness and everything else.” Che added sarcastically: “Thus ends the story of two heroic guerrillas.” On October 4, Che wrote that he had heard a commentary on the radio whose conclusion had been that if he was captured by troops of the Fourth Army Division, he would be tried in Camiri, but if by the Eighth Division, he would be tried in Santa Cruz.<p></p><p></p>On Saturday, October 7, the last day Che made an entry in his diary, he and his men camped in one of the many ravines near La Higuera. There they encountered an old woman herding goats and attempted to ques-tion her about the presence of soldiers in the area, but they were unable to obtain any reliable information. Afterward, fearing that the old woman would report them, Che ordered two of his men to go to her house and pay her 50 pesos to keep quiet. He noted in his diary, however, that he had little hope that she would do as instructed. He began this last entry in his diary with a notation that it had been exactly 11 months since the in-auguration of his guerrilla movement.<p></p><p></p>Apparently, the old woman or someone else who had seen Che and his group pass through the area reported their presence to the army in La Higuera. By the morning of Sunday, October 8, several companies of Rangers were deployed in the zone through which Che’s small force was moving. Early that morning Captain Gary Prado and his company of Rangers, all recent graduates of the U.S. Army Special Forces training camp near Santa Cruz, took up positions on the heights of the Quebrada de Yuro, one of the most rugged ravines in the area. Che and his men, after marching the night before, had stopped to rest in this ravine until they could resume marching under cover of darkness.<p></p><p></p>About noon, a small probing unit from Prado’s company made contact with the guerrillas. In this initial encounter, two soldiers were killed and<p></p> 
164	CHE GUEVARA<p></p><p></p>several others wounded. The lieutenant in charge of the unit radioed Captain Prado for assistance. The subsequent series of events reads like a scenario out of a U.S. Army counterinsurgency manual. Captain Prado immediately deployed the rest of his troops in a circle around the guer-rillas. Meanwhile, Che divided his small force into two groups in an ef-fort to confuse the Rangers and escape. The group led by Che moved toward the closest exit from the ravine. However, the hill commanding this exit was occupied by a sizable number of troops and had been cho-sen by Captain Prado as the site of his command post. As Che and his group came within shooting range of Prado’s men, they found themselves caught in a rain of automatic weapons fi re.<p></p><p></p>Captain Prado watched the guerrillas disperse and run for cover through his fi eld glasses and ordered Sergeant Bernardino Huanca and his men to descend in pursuit. A few minutes later, Sergeant Huanca fired a burst from his submachine gun at a guerrilla moving through a thicket of thorn bushes. One bullet sent the guerrilla’s black beret flying off his head, while two others tore into his leg and forced him to the ground. The fallen guerrilla was Che. As he lay helpless the Rangers began to concentrate their fire on the area where he had fallen. But Willy (Simón Cuba, one of Moisés Guevara’s recruits whom Che had begun to regard as a potential deserter) rushed to his side and helped him out of the line of fire and up one side of the ravine. As the two scrambled upward, they ran into four Rangers who were positioning a mortar. The Rangers or-dered them to surrender, but Che, supporting himself against a tree, fired his carbine in answer. The soldiers returned the fire. A few seconds later, a bullet hit the barrel of Che’s carbine, rendering it useless and wound-ing him in the right forearm. At this point, Che reportedly raised his hands and shouted: “Don’t shoot! I’m Che Guevara, and I’m worth more to you alive than dead.” A few yards away, Willy threw down his rifle and also surrendered.<p></p><p></p>It was approximately 4:00 in the afternoon when Che and Willy were brought before Captain Prado. The latter immediately ordered his radio operator to signal the divisional headquarters in Vallegrande and tell them that they had captured Che Guevara. When the radio opera-tor established contact with Vallegrande he shouted: “Hello, Saturno, we have Papa!” (“Saturno” was the code name for Colonel Joaquín Zenteno, commandant of the Eighth Bolivian Army Division, and “Papa”<p></p> 
THE TRAGIC DEATH OF A REVOLUTIONARY	165<p></p><p></p>was the code name they used for Che). In disbelief, Colonel Zenteno asked Captain Prado to confi rm the message. Following the confi rma-tion, there was general euphoria among Colonel Zenteno’s divisional headquarters staff. When the back patting subsided, Colonel Zenteno radioed Prado to immediately bring Che and any other prisoners to La Higuera.<p></p><p></p>Since the Rangers had come into the Quebrada de Yuro on foot, Che had to be transported the seven kilometers to La Higuera stretched out in a blanket carried by four soldiers. Willy was forced to walk behind with his hands tied against his back. They arrived in La Higuera shortly after dark. The prisoners were placed in the little town’s two-room school-house, Che in one room and Willy in the other. Later the Rangers brought in a third guerrilla, a Bolivian named Aniceto (Aniceto Reinaga), who had been taken prisoner near where Che and Willy were captured. He was placed in the classroom with Willy. The bodies of four other guerril-las were also brought to La Higuera that night.<p></p><p></p>

166	CHE GUEVARA<p></p><p></p>The remaining group of guerrillas, led by Inti Peredo, had gone to the opposite end of the Quebrada when Che ordered the column to separate. They were able to hide until nightfall and then slip out of the ravine. In subsequent weeks, half the members of this second group were killed by the army. Of those who survived, the three remaining Cubans fled the country via Chile, and the three surviving Bolivians who included Inti went into hiding.<p></p><p></p>During the night of October 8, and the next morning, Che was in-terrogated by various army offi cers, including Major Miguel Ayoroa, Colonel Andrés Selich, Captain Prado, and Colonel Zenteno. He was also questioned by the CIA agent who called himself Félix Ramos (Félix Rodríguez), one of the Cuban exiles sent by the CIA to participate in the counterinsurgency campaign against the guerrillas. Che refused to an-swer any of their questions, but he did exchange a few words with some of the officers and soldiers around him. At one point, one of the younger officers asked Che what he was thinking about. At first, Che ignored him, but when he overheard the officer say sarcastically to another officer that he (Che) was probably thinking about the immortality of the burro, Che answered: “No, I’m thinking about the immortality of the revolution.” On another occasion, one of the junior officers, who had drunk too much in celebration of Che’s capture, tried to harass him. Che responded by punching the offi cer in the face. Although Che’s wounds were painful, they were not serious, and he remained conscious during this entire period.<p></p><p></p>In La Paz, President Barrientos and the high command of the Bolivian Armed Forces held an emergency meeting to decide what to do with Che. They ruled out any prospect of prosecuting him through judicial proceedings, because they reasoned a trial would focus world attention on him and present the Communists with a propaganda field day. More-over, since Bolivia did not have the death penalty, they feared that if Che remained alive as their prisoner, sympathizers from all over the world would converge on Bolivia in an effort to save him or carry on his fight. They decided, therefore, that Che had to be executed immediately. Moreover, they decided that they would announce he had died from wounds received in battle.<p></p><p></p>Early on the morning of Monday, October 9, the top-ranking officers in La Higuera received the order from La Paz to execute Che. They in<p></p> 
THE TRAGIC DEATH OF A REVOLUTIONARY	167<p></p><p></p>turn instructed the noncommissioned offi cers present to carry out the order. Since none of the latter were anxious to do so, they chose lots to determine who would execute Che. Several hours before, these noncom-missioned officers, as well as the officers and the soldiers on guard around the schoolhouse where Che was being held prisoner, had divided among themselves the money and personal effects taken from Che after his cap-ture. His watches, carbine, compass, Parker fountain pen, two berets (in-cluding the one with a bullet hole through it), belt, stainless steel dagger, two pipes, and cigarette holder were the most important pieces of booty distributed among those who had had the honor of participating in the capture of the famous guerrilla leader.<p></p><p></p>Shortly before noon on Monday, October 9, 1967, some 24 hours after Che and his men had been discovered in the Quebrada de Yuro, Sergeant Mario Terán walked to the little schoolhouse in La Higuera to carry out the order sent down from the Bolivian government’s top leaders in La Paz. He had drawn the shortest straw. When he entered the class-room where his victim was waiting, he found him propped up against one of the walls. Che guessed the nature of Sergeant Terán’s mission and calmly asked him to wait a moment until he stood up. Terán was so fright-ened by the prospect of what he had to do that he began to tremble. He turned and ran from the schoolhouse. But both Colonel Selich and Colonel Zenteno ordered him to go back and shoot Che without further delay. Still trembling, Terán returned to the classroom, and without look-ing at his victim’s face, he fi red a burst from his carbine. The bullets slammed into Che’s chest and side, passed through his body, and made large holes in the soft adobe wall of the classroom. The sergeant had been told not to infl ict any wounds in Che’s head or heart so that the army could later claim that he had died from wounds received in combat. How-ever, while Terán’s carbine was still smoking, several soldiers pushed past him into the classroom. They said that they too wanted to shoot Che so that they could boast that they had shot the famous Che Guevara. Sergeant Terán weakly nodded his approval and they began fi ring.<p></p><p></p>When the shooting was over, there were nine bullet wounds in Che’s body, two of which were obviously instantaneously fatal. Moments later, Willy and Aniceto were executed by another sergeant in Captain Prado’s company. The shooting resounded through the streets of the village, startling the townspeople and causing them to crowd around the little<p></p> 
168	CHE GUEVARA<p></p><p></p>schoolhouse. In a short time, the entire town knew what had taken place there.<p></p>Soon after Che and his comrades were shot, the senior army officers and the CIA agent, Félix Rodríguez, left La Higuera by helicopter for the army headquarters in Vallegrande. Che’s body was wrapped in canvas and strapped to the runner of a helicopter bound for Vallegrande. At the Vallegrande airstrip, nearly half the population of the town awaited the arrival of Che’s body. Colonel Zenteno had announced several hours earlier that Che was dead and would soon be brought to Vallegrande.<p></p><p></p>When the helicopter arrived in Vallegrande, it landed on the side of the airstrip away from the waiting crowd of townspeople, reporters, and soldiers. Before the rotor of the helicopter had stopped, Che’s body was loaded into the back of a white Chevrolet panel truck (the type used at the time as ambulances throughout most of Latin America) and trans-ported at high speed through Vallegrande’s narrow streets to the Señor de Malta Hospital.<p></p><p></p>The body was placed in an adobe laundry shack apart from the main hospital building. In this shack several offi cials washed the blood from<p></p><p></p>

THE TRAGIC DEATH OF A REVOLUTIONARY	169<p></p><p></p>Che’s body, made an incision in his neck for embalming fl uid, and took his fingerprints. According to two British journalists who arrived on the scene early, the entire process appeared to be under the supervision of a CIA agent who called himself Dr. Eduardo González (Gustavo Vil-loldo). He refused to let the two journalists photograph Che, and when they asked him in English where he was from, he answered sarcastically: “From nowhere!”<p></p><p></p>Soon General Alfredo Ovando, head of the Bolivian Armed Forces, and a number of other top military figures came to see the body of the fa-mous guerrilla. By this time, a large crowd had excitedly collected around the shack. They probably would have broken through the cordon of sol-diers trying to hold them back had it not been for the quick intervention of General Ovando. The general explained that they all had a right to see Che but that they would have to wait until the doctors and other of-fi cials had fi nished preparing and identifying the body.<p></p><p></p>Once the doctors and the officials had finished their work, the soldiers allowed the waiting newsmen to enter the shack and take pictures. Af-terward, they let townspeople file past to view the corpse. Throughout the night a silent file of staring townspeople, peasants from the surround-ing area, and soldiers passed by the body. Che’s body was on a stretcher that had been placed across the length of a concrete laundry sink. He was nude from the waist up—the officials had removed his jacket during the preceding investigation and preparation. The bullet wounds in his chest and sides were almost inconspicuous. He looked amazingly alive. Not only were his eyes open and brilliant but there was a haunting smile on his lips. Pictures of this vibrant and serene expression were conveyed around the world by the news media.<p></p><p></p>Che’s body was exhibited in the hospital at Vallegrande for approxi-mately 24 hours. What happened to it afterward was a mystery to the world until almost 30 years later. On October 11, 1967, General Ovando<p></p><p></p>fi rst stated that the body had been buried in the Vallegrande area. The next day, however, General Ovando’s office officially announced that the body had been cremated, and President Barrientos said a few days af-terward that Che’s ashes had been buried in a hidden place somewhere in the Vallegrande region. Almost nine months later, an article in the Peruvian paper La Prensa claimed that members of President Barrientos’s personal guard had told a high functionary in the Peruvian police, when<p></p> 
170	CHE GUEVARA<p></p><p></p>the Bolivian president visited Lima in July, that Che’s body had been taken to the United States by the CIA in order to prevent it from falling into the hands of Marxists intent on sanctifying his remains. But a few days later, President Barrientos’s personal guard publicly denied that any of its members had said anything to anyone about Che’s body during the president’s visit to Peru.<p></p><p></p>In any case, the rapid disposal of the body was probably motivated by the impending arrival in La Paz of Che’s brother, Roberto Guevara, who was intent on claiming the body and taking it back to Argentina. When Roberto, a lawyer, arrived in Bolivia on October 12, he was told that it was impossible for him to see his brother’s body since it had been cre-mated the day before. Not wanting to believe that his brother had been killed, Roberto asked to see the hands that the Bolivian officials claimed that they had cut from the body as proof that it was really Che Guevara that they had killed. But he was denied even this request and was forced to return to Argentina without having seen any evidence that his brother died in Bolivia. However, a few days later, a team of Argentine police ex-perts arrived in La Paz in response to an invitation by President Barrie-ntos sent to General Onganía, the military dictator ruling Argentina at the time. The Argentine police experts were allowed to examine Che’s hands and compare his fi ngerprints with those in the fi les of the Ar-gentine Federal Police. On their departure, they issued an offi cial state-ment to the effect that the fi ngerprints were identical and belonged to Ernesto “Che” Guevara.<p></p><p></p>The contradictions in the offi cial statements given by the Bolivian authorities with regard to the disposition of Che’s body were minor com-pared to those that appeared in statements concerning how and when Che died. On October 13, Dr. José Martínez Casso, one of the two doctors at the Señor de Malta Hospital who had been asked by the military to conduct an autopsy on Che’s body, reported to the press that Che had re-ceived two mortal wounds, one in the lungs and the other in the heart. He also stated that, on examining the body shortly after it had been brought to the hospital in Vallegrande, he had estimated that Che had died not more than five or six hours earlier. The doctor’s statements obviously in-dicated that Che had died from wounds he received shortly before be-ing brought to Vallegrande, not during the battle in the Quebrada de Yuro on the previous Sunday.<p></p> 
THE TRAGIC DEATH OF A REVOLUTIONARY	171<p></p><p></p>Yet on the same day that Dr. Martínez Casso made his statement, Colonel Zenteno stated before a press conference that although he was not able to say precisely when Che had died, it was “almost immediately after he was wounded in combat.” This was contradicted on the same day by General Ovando, who stated that Che had died early Monday morning (October 9) as a consequence of wounds received the previous afternoon in combat. Although Che could not have lived overnight with a fatal bullet wound in both his heart and lungs, General Ovando denied emphatically and indignantly the suggestion that Che had been shot to death after he was taken prisoner.<p></p><p></p>The seemingly endless capacity of the Bolivian officials to contradict themselves not only made it clear that Che had been executed but also demonstrated that the government and military were incapable of dis-cussing the matter without creating confusion and making embarrassing errors. The government’s bungled efforts to sell Che’s campaign diary (obtained along with other important items when he was captured in the Quebrada de Yuro), and the incredible circumstances surrounding the clandestine delivery of the diary for free to Cuba by none other than one of the top officials in President Barrientos’s cabinet, were further evi-dence of the weaknesses, both moral and otherwise, in the Bolivian re-gime. Indeed, the entire episode involving the release of his diary had the appearance of a nightmarish comedy of errors. This tragic comedy oc-curred when I arrived on the scene in Bolivia some eight months after Che’s death.<p></p><p></p>The success of any guerrilla movement depends on the degree of sup-port it receives from the civilian population in its area of operations. Che knew this truth well and mentioned it frequently in his writings on guerrilla warfare. For example, he wrote:<p></p><p></p>It is important to emphasize that the guerrilla struggle is a mass struggle, it is the struggle of a people. . . . The guerrilla fighter there-fore relies on the complete support of the people of the area. This is absolutely indispensable. (Guevara 1960)<p></p><p></p>However, the complete absence of popular support for his guerrilla op-eration in Bolivia was one of the main reasons, if not the prime reason, that his mission there failed.<p></p>

AP Images.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Revolutionary guerrilla warfare depends on, and is a struggle for, the loyalties of the civilian population. Close guerrilla-civilian cooperation enables guerrillas to develop a superior system of intelligence, have ex-treme mobility, cache an inexhaustible source of supplies, and surprise the enemy’s forces when they are off guard. Without close ties to the civilian population, guerrillas cannot develop even the minimal level of capabilities necessary for successful guerrilla warfare.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>REASONS FOR THE LACK OF POPULAR SUPPORT FOR CHE’S GUERRILLA MOVEMENT<p></p><p></p>One of the reasons Che’s guerrilla movement failed to obtain any popu-lar support in Bolivia is the majority of Bolivians at that time believed their country had already undergone its revolution of national libera-tion. Although Che visited Bolivia shortly after the revolution of 1952,<p></p> 
THE TRAGIC DEATH OF A REVOLUTIONARY	173<p></p><p></p>he failed to perceive then or later how much importance the Bolivians attached to this event. In fact, for many Bolivians, the revolution of 1952 was regarded in much the same way as the Cubans regard their re-volution. Because Che did not understand this fact, and because his Bo-livian sources of information did not convey it to him, he believed his guerrilla movement would be able to capitalize on the hostility and dis-content he assumed the Bolivian people felt toward their political rulers.<p></p><p></p>What Che failed to understand is the revolution of 1952 gave the Bolivian masses, for the fi rst time in Bolivian history, what they per-ceived as a real stake in the social order as well as a sense of involvement in the political system and cultural community of their country. Despite the military coup of 1964 and the consequent fall from power of the Na-tional Revolutionary Movement (the group that spearheaded the revo-lution of 1952 and governed the country until the military coup), the changes set in motion by the revolution had continuing relevance for most of the Bolivian population in the mid-1960s when Che and his comrades arrived on the scene. These developments had a profound im-pact on the character of Bolivian politics and contributed greatly to the development of a sense of national consciousness among Bolivia’s ru-ral masses.<p></p><p></p>Che failed to appreciate the importance of this national conscious-ness and believed the Bolivian peasantry and the workers would provide a popular base for his revolutionary guerrilla movement in Bolivia and subsequently in neighboring countries. However, conditions for creat-ing a successful revolutionary foco were obviously not present in Bolivia in the mid-1960s. In the first place, the guerrillas could not hope to win the support of the rural masses by offering to give them land. Since 1952 Bolivia’s peasants had controlled the land and the entire countryside. Moreover, they had seen some improvement in their political, social, and economic status and they had hopes of greater improvement.<p></p><p></p>This is not to say that they were well off, for their situation was, and still is, one of the worst in Latin America. Nevertheless, they were much better off in the mid-1960s than they had been in the past. Furthermore, the peasants were not isolated from the centers of national political power. Through their local syndicates they had a significant voice in the country’s political affairs, and certain groups, such as the campesinos in<p></p> 
174	CHE GUEVARA<p></p><p></p>the Cochabamba area, even had direct access to President Barrientos. Consequently, the leaders of the peasant syndicates and many of their members did not regard the political authorities as enemies of the people.<p></p><p></p>In view of the peasantry’s increased involvement in national affairs, they perceived Che’s guerrilla movement in totally different terms than he expected. Instead of supporting Che’s guerrilla movement, they opposed it. For example, at the end of June 1967, the National Congress of Farm Workers issued a public declaration in which they denounced the guerril-las as an “anti-national force, financed from abroad and destined to cre-ate nothing but confusion and disruption.” This group further stated that they were ready to cooperate with the armed forces “in totally liquidating this foreign aggression that is attempting to undermine in a systematic manner the economic and social development of our people.”<p></p><p></p>That the Bolivian public perceived the guerrillas as foreigners seri-ously handicapped the guerrilla movement. Saddled with this stigma, it was impossible for them to win widespread popular support among the general population. In fact, certain Bolivian observers referred to the for-eign character of Che’s guerrilla movement as its “original sin.” Since the guerrilla operation was neither organized nor led by Bolivians, it aroused a nationalistic reaction among nearly every segment of Bolivian society. The foreign character of the guerrilla operation also made it possible for President Barrientos and the Bolivian military to wrap themselves in the Bolivian fl ag and play the role of defenders of the Bolivian nation.<p></p><p></p>Even if Che’s group had not been marked with the stigma of “foreign in-truders,” it seems highly unlikely they would have been able to establish a base of popular support among the peasantry in the southeast of Bolivia. The peasantry would not have been receptive to any type of armed upris-ing. The fact that Che and his group were considered foreigners, of course, made it impossible for them to develop an armed uprising among the ru-ral population, and so they found themselves isolated and surrounded on all sides by informers and government sympathizers.<p></p><p></p><p></p>U.S. INVOLVEMENT IN THE DEFEAT<p></p><p></p>OF CHE’S GUERRILLA FORCE<p></p> 
<p></p>Sensationalist claims that the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) brought down Che have no factual foundation at all. To be sure, the<p></p> 
THE TRAGIC DEATH OF A REVOLUTIONARY	175<p></p><p></p>CIA was ever present during the entire episode; they certainly were de-termined to see that Che was defeated and, if possible, captured. How-ever, they were not responsible for the failure of Che’s guerrilla opera-tion or his execution. In fact, the U.S. government and the CIA appear to have opposed the idea of executing Che. Purely for professional rea-sons, the CIA wanted to keep him alive. This appears to have been the position of the U.S. government from the highest levels down to the two CIA agents on the scene. Thus, in his (now declassified) memorandum to President Lyndon Johnson confirming the death of Che Guevara, Walt Rostow (who was the president’s special assistant for National Security Affairs) told the president the following:<p></p><p></p><p></p>CIA tells us that the latest information is Guevara was taken alive. After a short interrogation to establish his identity, General Ovando—Chief of the Bolivian Armed Forces—ordered him shot. I regard this as stupid, but it is understandable from a Bolivian standpoint given the problems which the sparing of French Com-munist and Castro courier Regis Debray has caused them.<p></p><p></p><p></p>Rostow also provides in this memorandum his analysis of the “signifi - cant implications” of Che’s death. He wrote:<p></p><p></p>It marks the passing of another of the aggressive, romantic rev-olutionaries like Sukarno, Nkrumah, Ben Bella . . . and rein-forces this trend.<p></p>In the Latin American context, it will have a strong impact in discouraging would-be guerrillas.<p></p>It shows the soundness of our “preventive medicine” assistance to countries facing incipient insurgency—it was the Bolivian 2nd Ranger Battalion, trained by our Green Berets from June– September of this year that cornered and got him.<p></p><p></p>Rostow closed the memorandum with the comment that he had “put these points across to several newsmen” (Rostow 1967).<p></p>Gustavo Villoldo, one of the two CIA agents on the scene at Che’s capture, claims: “At no time did I or the CIA have a say in executing<p></p> 
176	CHE GUEVARA<p></p><p></p>Che . . . that was a Bolivian decision” (Tamayo 1997). The other CIA agent present was Félix Rodríguez, who later became the president of the militant Cuban-exile organization Brigade 2506. He has claimed re-peatedly he was under CIA instructions to “do everything possible to keep him alive,” but Rodríguez has also admitted he transmitted the or-der to execute Guevara that came by radio from the Bolivian high com-mand to the soldiers at La Higuera. And he also claims he directed them not to shoot Guevara in the face so that his wounds would appear to be combat related (Miami’s Cuban Connection 2006).<p></p><p></p>Rodríguez contends he personally informed Che that he would be killed. He told Miami’s Cuban Connection in a 2006 interview: “I walked in and gave the order to untie him. Che had asked if we could untie him and let him sit down. Later, the order came from the Bolivian govern-ment to shoot him. I tried in all my power to stop them because of my in-structions to take him to Panama for the CIA. . . . At the end, I asked him if he wanted me to do something for his family. He said ‘Tell my wife to marry again and try to be happy.’ We shook hands, hugged. I left the room and someone came in and shot him.” Later in this interview he said it was Sergeant Mario Terán who shot Che. After Che was exe-cuted, Rodríguez claims he took Che’s Rolex watch, which he has proudly shown reporters over the years.<p></p><p></p>If the CIA agents advised the Bolivians to keep Che alive, this advice was clearly rejected by the Bolivian government’s top leaders, who felt they could not afford to allow the famous revolutionary to live. Bolivia had no death penalty, so they were afraid an imprisoned Che would become a cause célèbre that would attract leftists to the country from around the world. Moreover, if they turned him over to the CIA, they would give the world and the Bolivian people the impression the U.S. government was running things in Bolivia. They felt they had no other choice politically but to execute Che. They also decided to cover this up by claiming he died after capture from wounds received in battle.<p></p><p></p>Exaggerated claims about U.S. involvement in the defeat of Che’s guerrilla force have also been made with regard to the use of infrared ae-rial cameras by U.S. planes to detect and locate the guerrillas. One jour-nalist in particular asserted the mud ovens used by the guerrillas made it possible for the U.S. Air Force to pinpoint their location at all times by using new, highly sensitive heat-detecting cameras in an around-<p></p>

However, after leaving their main camp in the Ñancahuazú area, where they did have a mud oven, the guerrillas never stayed anywhere long enough to build another one. In fact, they rarely even built fi res.<p></p>Furthermore, the Bolivian authorities knew at least the general loca-tion of the guerrillas throughout the entire period from their initial dis-covery to their elimination in October. They did not have to rely on such sophisticated American gimmickry as heat-sensing infrared cameras. For one thing, during the first four months of operations, Che’s column clashed with the army fairly frequently, and it was possible to ascertain simply from these encounters their general location. Moreover, the army constantly received information about them from the local peasantry. In fact, the irony of the situation is that the Bolivian military knew far more about the guerrillas than the latter knew about the army—the exact re-versal of the usual situation in guerrilla warfare.<p></p><p></p>In sum, the U.S. involvement in Bolivian affairs was extensive, but the U.S. contribution to the military defeat of Che’s guerrilla operation was minimal and then only at the end. To be sure, the U.S. trained the<p></p> 
178	CHE GUEVARA<p></p><p></p>Rangers of the Second Manchego Rangers Regiment who were respon-sible for capturing Che and almost completely eliminating his small force in October 1967. However, Che’s guerrilla operation was already defeated prior to the arrival on the scene of the U.S.-trained Rangers. His force had lost over half of its original members and had failed to win any popular support. Moreover, the hostility of the pro-Soviet Commu-nist Party leaders and the indifference of the other leftist groups in Bo-livia, together with the capture of the guerrillas’ urban contacts in La Paz, had left Che and the tattered remnants of his original force com-pletely and hopelessly isolated by the time the Rangers entered into combat against them.<p></p> 
<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Chapter 11<p></p><p></p>CHE’S DIARY AND<p></p><p></p>HIDDEN REMAINS<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Following Che’s capture and execution, the Barrientos government de-cided to sell Che’s diary to the publisher willing to pay the highest price (the information in this chapter is based on the author’s original re-search; see Harris 2007:227–56). However, while the Bolivians were negotiating the sale of the diary, the Cuban government mysteriously obtained a copy and released it through publishing houses in Latin America, Europe, and the United States. By publishing the diary before the Bolivians could sell it, the Cuban government was able to score a significant propaganda victory and greatly embarrass the Barrientos re-gime. Moreover, the questions about how the Cubans got a copy of the diary gave rise to serious doubts in Bolivia about the integrity of the gov-ernment and the armed forces. Clearly, someone in the civilian side of the government or the military had placed a copy of this top-secret doc-ument in the hands of the Cuban government.<p></p><p></p>Che’s diary was made public in Havana on July 1, 1968, shortly after I had arrived in La Paz, and within a few days it was distributed by leftist publishers in Chile, Mexico, France, Italy, West Germany, and the United States. A few weeks later, on July 17, Antonio Arguedas, Minister of the Interior and a close friend of President Barrientos, fl ed to Chile and<p></p> 
180	CHE GUEVARA<p></p><p></p>was denounced by General Ovando as the traitor who had provided the Cuban government with photographic copies of Che’s diary. The Bo-livian public was stunned by the news, and most of the population re-garded Arguedas’s actions as a national disgrace.<p></p>Since Arguedas had been President Barrientos’s right-hand man, the whole affair seriously undermined the public’s confi dence in the Barri-entos regime and within 24 hours plunged the country into a grave po-litical crisis that broke apart the coalition of political parties that had previously supported Barrientos. At the same time, the three main op-position parties (the rightwing Socialist Falange, the centrist National Revolutionary Movement, and the Trotskyist Revolutionary Party of the Nationalist Left) issued a manifesto calling on the Barrientos govern-ment to resign. They also called a mass demonstration in the capital on July 20, which resulted in a violent clash with the police and the death of a captain of the Civil Guard.<p></p><p></p>The leaders of the demonstration were arrested, and Barrientos de-clared a nationwide state of emergency. He also called on the peasant syndicates in the Cochabamba area to come to his assistance, and 5,000 armed campesinos from the Cochabamba Valley were mobilized and moved to the outskirts of La Paz. This appears to have been the turning point in the crisis. Soon thereafter Barrientos received expressions of public support from the various military garrisons throughout the coun-try, as well as several important political groups. Ironically, the crisis aris-ing from the publication of Che’s diary, and particularly Arguedas’s part in the whole affair, almost toppled the Barrientos regime—something Che’s guerrilla operation never came close to achieving while he was alive.<p></p><p></p>But the Arguedas affair did not end there. Much to everyone’s sur-prise, approximately a month after his flight from the country, Antonio Arguedas voluntarily returned to Bolivia to stand trial for his actions. In Chile Arguedas had publicly declared that he wanted to return to Bolivia to clear his name. However, most Bolivians assumed he had received a large sum of money from the Cubans in return for Che’s diary, so no one took seriously his announced intention to return home. This made it all the more surprising when he did return to Bolivia, following a month-long odyssey that took him to Buenos Aires, Madrid, London, New York, and Lima, before arriving back in La Paz.<p></p> 
CHE’S DIARY AND HIDDEN REMAINS	181
<p></p>When he arrived in Bolivia, Arguedas told the press that he had re-turned in order to clear his conscience and face the consequences of his past actions. His exact words to the Bolivian press were the following:<p></p><p></p>I am not looking for publicity. I only want to tell the truth about everything that occurred in my career as a subsecretary and minis-ter of government, and alert not only the present government of Bolivia, but all the governments of Latin America, as to how North American imperialism undermines their intelligence services in order to introduce errors, to distort, to present a completely differ-ent picture of reality, to obstruct their economic relations with other states, and finally to keep them under its control.<p></p><p></p>He said he had returned in order to regain his personal dignity by telling the truth at the moment when it was most appropriate to do so. In this regard, he reminded the reporters he had been the favorite of both the Americans and the most reactionary political elements in Bolivia prior to his sending Che’s diary to Fidel Castro, and that he had given up a promising political career because of his disgust over the undermining of Bolivia’s national sovereignty by U.S. political and economic interests.<p></p><p></p>At the press conference following his return to Bolivia, Arguedas refuted the suggestion that he had given a copy of Che’s diary to Fidel Castro because he was a Castroite or because he was a Communist. He denied being either a Castroite or a Communist and stated that he was a nationalist first and a Marxist second. With regard to the accusation that he had received a large sum of money for the diary, Arguedas angrily re-torted that this was another of the CIA’s insidious attempts to discredit him by slander. He argued that if it had been money he was after, it would have been unnecessary for him to sell Che’s diary to the Cubans. Arguedas pointed out that as minister of internal affairs he could have made a fortune in bribes from the Americans if he had wanted to do so. He said he had documents hidden outside the country that, among other things, proved that a U.S. engineering fi rm (which he named) had of-fered him a bribe of $1.5 million to see that they were awarded a govern-ment contract for the construction of two new highways. In other words, he argued that he had rejected bribes of much greater amounts than the $500,000 it was rumored he had received from the Cubans for the diary.<p></p> 
182	CHE GUEVARA<p></p><p></p>The Arguedas affair is one consequence of Che’s guerrilla opera-tion that Che himself could never have foreseen. Arguedas’s actions shook the Barrientos regime to the core, whereas Che’s guerrilla activi-ties, at least before the Arguedas affair, had the effect of strengthening the Barrientos regime and the Bolivian military. By calling into question the integrity of the government and the armed forces, Arguedas’s actions weakened the Barrientos regime and the public’s confidence in the ex-isting political system. Moreover, Arguedas’s return to Bolivia and his revelations about the nature of the CIA’s interference in Bolivian af-fairs called into question the role of the United States government and companies in that country. In fact, the Arguedas affair provides shocking evidence about the nature of the U.S. government’s involvement in the domestic affairs of Latin American countries.<p></p><p></p>Following his press conference in the Ministry of the Interior the day of his return to Bolivia, Arguedas was placed in strict confi nement and not allowed to make any further statements to the press. However, within a few months he was released from prison as a result of the Boliv-ian high court’s decision that it did not have the authority to try him. According to the high court, the Bolivian legislature was the only body competent to try a former minister of state for acts of treason commit-ted while in office. Because of the court’s decision, Arguedas was released from prison pending action by the legislature.<p></p><p></p>He kept a low profi le after his release, but within a short time several attempts were made on his life. Twice bombs were thrown at him, and on June 6, 1969, he and a Spanish journalist accompanying him were machine-gunned while walking on the street in La Paz. Both Arguedas and the journalist escaped with minor wounds. However, Arguedas was hospitalized for almost a month, and immediately following his release from the hospital, he sought asylum in the Mexican embassy.<p></p><p></p>In a statement he gave to the press at the time, he explained that his intentions were to leave Bolivia and go to Mexico. He said that he had decided to leave Bolivia because of the increasing political instability in the country following the death of President Barrientos (who was killed when his personal helicopter crashed in mysterious circumstances) and because of the recent attempts on his life. He gave as an additional rea-son the failure of the government to take any action whatsoever against<p></p> 
CHE’S DIARY AND HIDDEN REMAINS	183
<p></p>the agents of U.S. imperialism who were at work undermining Bolivia’s national sovereignty.<p></p>During this time, Arguedas was the author of yet another incredible episode. He secretly arranged for Che’s hands, in a glass container of formaldehyde, and a plaster mask of his face (made in Vallegrande) to be sent to Cuba in much the same manner as he had arranged for the copies of Che’s diary to be sent there. However, in this case, the existence and transfer of these items to Cuba were not discovered until many years later. In fact, to this day, the story of Che’s hands and his death mask is not widely known.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>CHE’S HANDS AND DEATH MASK<p></p><p></p>The odyssey of these two items is more complex and more diffi cult to follow than the story of Che’s diary. The man who cut off Che’s hands and made his death mask out of plaster was Roberto “Toto” Quintanilla, an offi cial in Arguedas’s ministry. Like many of the other fi gures asso-ciated with Che’s death, he was killed under unusual circumstances in November 1970. An unknown woman gunned him down with an au-tomatic weapon in his office in Hamburg, Germany, where he was serv-ing as the Bolivian consul. Nothing more is known about him than this. According to Arguedas, Che’s hands and his death mask were given to him by General Ovando after they had been inspected by the team of Argentine criminal investigators sent to Bolivia to verify Che’s fi n-gerprints.<p></p><p></p>General Ovando instructed Arguedas to dispose of both items imme-diately and to leave no traces of them. However, Arguedas chose to ig-nore Ovando’s orders and gave them for safekeeping to a close friend named Jorge Suarez, a Bolivian writer and the editor of the daily news-paper Jornada. In a little known interview that Suarez gave Argentine journalist Uki Goñi in 1995, Suarez claimed Arguedas asked him to come to his offi ce seven or eight days after Che’s death. Arguedas told him he wanted to discuss something very personal and urgent. When Suarez went to his offi ce, Arguedas produced a glass container and a translu-cent bag, the contents of both Suarez could not at first see clearly. After<p></p> 
184	CHE GUEVARA<p></p><p></p>Arguedas motioned for him to come closer and examine the two objects, Suarez saw two hands floating in the glass container and he saw a white plaster mask in the bag. As he studied the mask closely he saw that it was an extraordinarily good replica of Che’s face with his eyes open. He could even see the details of his beard. It did not appear to be the face of someone dead, rather of someone very much alive. Suarez told Goñi he would never forget that face (Goñi 1995).<p></p><p></p>Arguedas explained to Suarez that General Ovando had given him strict instructions to incinerate the hands and the mask and then scatter the ashes in a river, but that he had decided not to follow these orders. He asked Suarez to take the items with him and hide them in his home. Although he was shocked and frightened, Suarez agreed to do what his friend asked him. According to Suarez, Arguedas said he was an admirer of Che and that the top levels of the Bolivian military and the U.S. em-bassy as well as certain other influential people did not trust him. In fact, he said the U.S. embassy suspected him of being a revolutionary and a possible contact for the guerrillas. By not destroying the death mask and Che’s hands Arguedas said that he was risking his life.<p></p><p></p>Suarez made a sort of sarcophagus, or stone coffi n, for the items un-der the floor of his bedroom and hid them there. Although his house was searched several times by the Bolivian secret police while Arguedas was in prison, Che’s hands and death mask were not discovered. They stayed under the fl oor in his bedroom until Suarez left Bolivia in 1969 as the new ambassador to Mexico, appointed by the military government of none other than General Ovando. Suarez told Goñi (1995) that the Bo-livian intelligence services and the CIA concluded afterward that he had probably carried Che’s hands and death mask out of the country in his diplomatic pouch, so they discontinued looking for them. However, he had left them hidden under the floor of his bedroom.<p></p><p></p>Meanwhile, following his release from prison, Arguedas sought ref-uge in the Mexican embassy while his request for political exile to Mex-ico was under consideration. When he learned that Suarez was leaving the country for Mexico, he made arrangements to have Che’s hands and death mask taken to Cuba in much the same way he had arranged for Che’s diary to be taken. In July 1969, he asked his journalist friend Víc-tor Zannier to arrange for the two items to be sent to Cuba. Zannier in turn delegated the mission to Jorge Sattori and Juan Coronel. Although<p></p> 
CHE’S DIARY AND HIDDEN REMAINS	185
<p></p>they were members of the pro-Soviet Bolivian Communist Party, Zan-nier felt they could be trusted, and he figured they could use the party’s international connections to get out of the country and travel to Cuba. Juan Coronel kept the glass container with Che’s hands and the bag with his death mask wrapped up in old newspapers under his bed for five months while he and Sattori made their arrangements to go to Cuba by way of Europe and the Soviet Union.<p></p><p></p>Coronel was struck by how much the death mask revealed Che’s fea-tures, and he described the glass container as cylindrical, about 10 inches high and 7 inches wide, and sealed with red wax. Inside were two hands floating in a brownish liquid. They appeared to have belonged to some-one who had been quite strong. He said they were covered in a beautiful film (most likely the ink used to record Che’s fingerprints), and they ap-peared to have been amputated with an inadequate instrument that left an irregular cut just before the wrists. Coronel’s description of the way the hands were amputated matches the image in the shocking photo-graphs of Che’s hands that were taken by the Argentine criminal inves-tigators who were sent to Bolivia to prove that the Bolivian military had indeed captured and killed the famous Che Guevara. Their story and the photos they took were not released until many years later (De Carlos 2006). In their photographs, Che’s hands are seen palm up on a news-paper page with the curled fingers covered in ink and the ink bottle and pad next to them.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>ARGUEDAS’S ODYSSEY<p></p><p></p>The Mexican embassy arranged for Arguedas to leave Bolivia and go to Mexico in 1969, where I met him briefly at a conference in Cuernavaca. He appeared to be quite happy in Mexico. However, he subsequently left Mexico for Cuba, where he was celebrated for his actions (Anderson 1997:745) and lived for nine years. While he was living in Havana, he was visited several times by Antonio Peredo (Estellano 2000), the oldest brother of Coco and Inti. Peredo is a well-known Bolivian jour-nalist, political activist, and university professor. According to Peredo, Arguedas lived a very disciplined and studious existence while he was in Cuba, and he regularly spent his days doing research in the libraries.<p></p> 
186	CHE GUEVARA<p></p><p></p>In 1979 Arguedas returned to Bolivia and disappeared from public view. In the mid-1980s, his name appeared again in the press because he was accused of being involved in an armed group that kidnapped a wealthy businessman. Although his involvement in this affair was never proved conclusively, he was arrested and remained in prison from 1986 to 1989. After his release, he dropped out of sight again and did not surface until 1997, the year the search for Che’s remains in Bolivia reached a crescendo and became a highly publicized international effort. During this period, the media and some of the people involved in the search for Che’s remains tried to locate Arguedas to see if he could tell them where Che’s body had been buried. However, the police found Arguedas first and arrested him for supposedly leading a gang that was planning to kid-nap businessmen in order to extract ransom money from their families and business associates. He was released by the police while awaiting trial, and he immediately went into hiding. Subsequently, he was de-clared a fugitive from justice when he failed to appear in court on the date of his trial.<p></p><p></p>During this time, he told Antonio Peredo that he had in his posses-sion the names of everyone involved in the drug trade in Bolivia, and that many people knew this. For this reason, he told Peredo: “I’m a dan-gerous man” (Estellano 2000). By this time, the Bolivian police were trying to link him to a series of bombings in La Paz. They arrested three men who they said belonged to a terrorist group that was led by Arguedas, but they were unable to present any serious proof that he was involved in this group.<p></p><p></p>Between November 20 and December 16, 1999, there were six bomb-ings in random locations around La Paz that made no sense and that were never explained by the police. The police accused Antonio Arguedas of being responsible for the bombings and for the deaths of several peo-ple who were killed by the bombings. He did not turn himself into the authorities and remained in hiding.<p></p><p></p>In February 2000, the police reported that he was killed in La Paz when a bomb he was carrying exploded. The police said he belonged to a right-wing group called C-4, which had declared war against Castroism, drugs, and corruption in Bolivia. But Arguedas’s family members and lo-cal political observers expressed serious doubts about the police account of his death (Estellano 2000). It remains unclear whether his death was<p></p> 
CHE’S DIARY AND HIDDEN REMAINS	187
<p></p>accidental or intentional. One newspaper account suggested that the police explanation of Arguedas’s death provided an ironic metaphor for his zigzagging political life. According to this account, instead of moving the timer on the bomb to the right to start its timing sequence, he moved it to the contact point on the left, and it instantly blew up in his hands (Clarín.com 2000). Of course, it is more likely he was killed by the po-lice. The true story of his death may never be known.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>CHE’S BODY<p></p><p></p>As for Che’s body, after it was displayed in Vallegrande it disappeared from public view and became a state secret. Since the Bolivian military refused to give any information to the public about this subject, there was considerable speculation about what happened to it. Some people believed the CIA had taken Che’s body back to the United States, others that his body had been cremated and his ashes spread over the jungle by air, and some thought he was buried in a secret location. It now appears that the CIA agent Gustavo Villoldo was responsible for burying Che’s body in an unmarked grave near the Vallegrande airport along with six of Che’s former companions in arms. At least this is where his bones were ultimately uncovered.<p></p><p></p>Thirty years after his death and following an almost 2-year search, in July 1997 a team of Cuban and Argentine experts found his remains with those of six of his comrades in an unmarked grave at the edge of the Val-legrande airport. The Cuban-Argentine team conclusively identified one of the skeletons as being Che’s remains on the basis of its facial bone structure, teeth, and absence of hands (Rother 1997). It also was found with a jacket and was not wearing socks, consistent with the last photo-graphs taken of Che after he was killed, which show him lying on a jacket and without socks.<p></p><p></p>The search for and discovery of Che’s remains in Bolivia adds yet an-other page to the remarkable story of his life and death and reveals that his legacy continues to take on new dimensions as time passes. On No-vember 26, 1995, the New York Times published an article containing statements of retired Bolivian army general Mario Vargas Salinas to the effect that Che’s body had been buried under the landing strip at the<p></p> 
188	CHE GUEVARA<p></p><p></p>Vallegrande airport (Castañeda 1997:404–5). In fact, the widow of Colo-nel Andrés Selich told the journalist Jon Lee Anderson, who was col-lecting information for his biographical book on Che Guevara, that her husband and a couple of other Bolivian army officers (including Vargas) had buried Che’s body and the bodies of six of his comrades in two un-marked graves dug by a bulldozer near the Vallegrande airport (Anderson 1997:742). When Anderson questioned Vargas (who wrote a book in 1988 about Che’s Bolivian operation), he told Anderson that all the bod-ies had been buried in one unmarked grave near the edge of the airport. The reporting of these details of Che’s death, especially in the New York Times by Thomas Lipscomb (November 26, 1995:3), caused a political uproar in Bolivia. It also stirred a great deal of interest in the interna-tional media and gave rise to a flood of new information about Che’s death and his fatal Bolivian mission.<p></p><p></p>Under pressure from the national and the international press, the president of Bolivia ordered the army to recover the bodies of Che and his comrades. What followed was a rather bizarre and highly publicized search for their bodies by an odd assortment of Bolivians, Cubans, and Argentines, which attracted many onlookers and reporters (Anderson 1997:xv). The whole affair turned out to be a source of considerable em-barrassment for the Bolivian government and military since it resur-rected a controversial chapter in Bolivia’s political history. For his part in the whole affair, Vargas was placed under house arrest for revealing state secrets.<p></p><p></p>The little town of Vallegrande, with a population of approximately 8,000 people, was in the news again, but this time because of the pres-ence of Cuban forensic anthropologists and geologists. At fi rst, they located the remains of only 5 of the guerrillas, a fraction of the 32 guerril-las who were killed in the area and buried in unmarked graves. But for 16 months there was no sign of Che’s body.<p></p><p></p>Meanwhile, Vallegrande’s municipal government leaders declared Che’s remains were a “national patrimony” and imposed a moratorium on the search until mid-June 1997. Someone in the town also started pro-moting a $70 per day walking tour of the route taken by Che and his com-rades before they were caught and killed, and there was talk of creating a museum. Loyola Guzman, who had been the treasurer of the clandes-tine urban network that supported Che’s guerrilla force before she and<p></p> 
CHE’S DIARY AND HIDDEN REMAINS	189
<p></p>the others were arrested and imprisoned by the Bolivian authorities, stated publicly that Che’s remains should rightfully remain in Bolivian soil. She argued that “his life was an example of heroic internationalism that no single country should monopolize.” Following her release from prison, Guzman returned to leftist activism and was very much involved in the campaign for the defense of human rights in Bolivia. In 2006 she was elected to the Constituent Assembly in Bolivia as one of the repre-sentatives of the Movimiento al Socialismo (MAS, or Movement to-ward Socialism). In Che’s diary, he noted that “Loyola made a very good impression on me. She is very young and sweet, but one notes a strong determination.”<p></p><p></p><p></p>THE DISCOVERY OF CHE’S BODY<p></p><p></p>The Cuban team met until 4 A.M. on June 28, 1997, before they decided where to focus their day of digging, according to Alejandro Inchaur-regui, one of a team of Argentine forensic anthropologists who were called in to help the Cubans (Tamayo 1997). Ground radar surveys made by the Cuban-Argentine search team earlier in 1997 had discov-ered a dozen spots of disturbed earth that they thought could be grave sites. Three of these sites appeared to be human made, and they decided to concentrate on these sites using a bulldozer—not the preferred tool of forensic specialists. However, time was running out for the Cuban-Argentine team of experts because of changing political circumstances in Bolivia.<p></p><p></p>They set the blade of the bulldozer to remove four inches of dirt with each pass of the blade. They found nothing at the first site, but at the second site after 18 passes the bulldozer blade uncovered the remains of a human skeleton. As they continued to dig they found the remains of a total of seven bodies in two groups, separated by two and a half feet. The bodies were buried in a pit between the edge of Vallegrande’s old dirt air-strip and a nearby cemetery. The searchers were overcome with emotion when they examined the remains of the second body that was in the middle of the first group of three skeletons. The skeleton had no hands. Since they knew Che’s hands had been amputated after his death, they were almost certain they had finally found his remains. The American author Jon Lee Anderson was present during the digging on this day,<p></p> 
190	CHE GUEVARA<p></p><p></p>and according to Anderson: “Just seeing the genuine excitement, the genuine euphoria on the face of the Cubans there [made] me certain this was Che’s remains . . . they were simply overcome, crying and hug-ging each other” (Tamayo 1997).<p></p>However, they still had to prove to the Bolivian government that the remains were those of Che and obtain permission to send them to Cuba. According to the Argentine forensic anthropologist Inchaurregui, the Bolivian Ministry of Interior officials had warned them they needed to move fast, since the inauguration of Bolivia’s newly elected right-wing president and former military dictator, Hugo Banzer, was rapidly ap-proaching and they assumed he would likely block the removal of Che’s remains. Thus, on the night of July 5, 1997, a convoy of vehicles with the remains of the guerrillas made the 150-mile trip at full speed along the dangerous mountain roads between Vallegrande and the provincial cap-ital of Santa Cruz.<p></p><p></p>In Santa Cruz, Che’s remains were quickly identifi ed. The team of examiners was composed of experts from the Institute of Forensic Medi-cine in Havana, the director of Che’s personal archive María del Carmen Ariet and the Argentine forensic anthropologists. They matched the evidence of bullet wounds in the bones of Skeleton 2 with the historical facts of Che’s death. The excavated teeth of Skeleton 2 matched a plas-ter mold of Che’s teeth made in Cuba before he left for the Congo. The mold had been made in the event he died in combat and his body had to be identified. Moreover, there was other evidence to support the conclu-sion that the remains were indeed those of Che Guevara.<p></p><p></p>For example, retired Bolivian Air Force General Jaime Nino de Guzman, the helicopter pilot who flew Che’s body and the bodies of the other guerrillas killed in or near La Higuera to Vallegrande, spoke with Che in La Higuera shortly before he was killed. He recalled that Che was shot in his right calf, his hair was matted and dirty, his clothes were shredded, and his feet were shod in rough handmade sandals. According to General Nino de Guzman, Che kept his head high, looked everyone in the eye, and asked only for something to smoke. The general told a reporter: “I took pity since he looked so terrible, and gave him my small bag of imported tobacco for his pipe. He smiled and thanked me” (Tamayo 1997). When the Argentine anthropologist Inchaurregui in-spected the jacket dug up next to Che’s remains, he found a small bag of<p></p> 
CHE’S DIARY AND HIDDEN REMAINS	191
<p></p>pipe tobacco in the inside pocket that had apparently been missed by the soldiers who searched Che’s body after he was killed in La Higuera. Gen-eral Nino de Guzman acknowledged that this was irrefutable evidence the remains were indeed Che’s. He told a reporter: “I must tell you I had serious doubts at the beginning. I thought the Cubans would just find any old bones and call it Che. . . . But after hearing about the tobacco pouch, I have no doubts” (Tamayo 1997).<p></p><p></p>The Bolivian government gave the Cubans permission to take Che’s remains to Cuba along with those of all the other guerrillas who were found buried in unmarked graves in Bolivia, including the bones of Tania (Haydée Tamara Bunke, the only woman in Che’s guerrilla force) and Joaquín (Comandante Juan Vitalio Acuña Nuñez, Che’s Cuban comrade and the second in command of the guerrilla force). Thus, on October 11, 1997, almost exactly 30 years after Che’s death, his remains and those of the other six fallen comrades found buried with him were placed on display in flag-draped caskets inside the monument to José Martí in Ha-vana (Los Angeles Times, October 12, 1997:A1). With a huge 50-foot mu-ral of Che overlooking the Plaza de la Revolución, hundreds of thousands of Cubans waited in line to pay their respects. After seven days of of-<p></p><p></p>fi cial mourning and national homage to Che’s life and ideals, the caskets were taken to the city of Santa Clara, where Che had led the guerrilla column that scored a decisive victory in the Cuban Revolution. In Santa Clara, Che’s coffin was placed in a newly constructed mausoleum at the base of a large statue of him holding a rifle in his hand.<p></p>At the quasi-religious ceremony held in Santa Clara, and in the pres-ence of Che’s widow, Aleida March, their two daughters and their two sons, Fidel Castro praised Che’s qualities as the ideal revolutionary. He closed his homage to Che before the assembled crowd with the follow-ing words: “Thank you, Che, for your history, your life and your ex-ample. Thank you for coming to reinforce us in the difficult struggle in which we are engaged today to preserve the ideas for which you fought so hard” (Rother 1997).<p></p>In the midst of this massive public veneration of Che, his daughter Aleida Guevara, who is a doctor like her father, told a press conference that her father always shunned public adulation when he was an impor-tant public figure in Cuba and that he probably would have been embar-rassed by all the celebrations in his honor. She also said that it hurt to see<p></p> 
192	CHE GUEVARA<p></p><p></p>the image of her father marketed for commercial purposes on ashtrays, beer, and jeans, but that she hoped some young people would see beyond this commercialism and search for the ideals that her father stood for, es-pecially in a globalized society that is losing all its values (Fineman 1997). Like his older sister, Che’s son Camilo Guevara, a lawyer in the Cuban Ministry of Fisheries, is protective of his father’s memory and image. He also has criticized what he characterizes as “the bad intentions” of some of the authors of the books published about his father.<p></p><p></p>Interestingly, in many of the articles published by U.S. newspapers on the return of Che’s remains to Cuba and the celebrations that were held in his honor, the reporters used the opportunity to criticize Cuba’s so-cialist system and Che Guevara’s ideas on revolution. They characterized them as anachronistic and no longer relevant in the contemporary pe-riod. However, the defeat of Che’s guerrilla operation in Bolivia does not indicate that an armed revolution is impossible in Latin America. As long as the existing political and economic elites in the region continue to postpone badly needed social and economic reforms and the gap be-tween the rich and the poor continues to increase, popular insurrection will remain on the agenda in Latin America and in other parts of the world with similar conditions. Moreover, the use of repressive and undemocratic measures by those in power to block peaceful and legal efforts to bring about basic economic, political, and social reforms in-variably provokes the use of nonpeaceful and extralegal means by those who see they have no other options if they want to create a more just social order.<p></p>

At the public tribute to Che held in the Plaza de la Revolución in Havana following his death in 1967, Fidel Castro (1967) heralded Che’s legacy when he said:<p></p><p></p>If we want a model of a person that does not belong to our time but to the future, I say from the depths of my heart that such a model, without a single stain on his conduct, on his actions, or his behavior, is Che!<p></p><p></p>Castro anticipated in his speech what has over the years become true: in Cuba and for his many admirers around the world Che has become a heroic model of the totally committed revolutionary, the selfl ess human being who dedicates his life for the common good to bring about a better future for humanity. In socialist Cuba, he is held up as the most outstanding example of the kind of human being Cuba’s socialist society is preparing for the 21st century and the socialist future just over the horizon.<p></p> 
194	CHE GUEVARA<p></p><p></p>Moreover, in the more than four decades that have passed since his death, Che has become an international revolutionary icon, a famous symbol of resistance to social injustice around the world. His romantic image and the revolutionary example he has left behind as his legacy have taken on a transcendent quality that appeals to people in diverse cultures and circumstances. An examination of the reasons for this phenomenon is of considerable importance, since it reveals a great deal about the nature and global significance of Che’s enduring legacy.<p></p><p></p><p></p>CHE HAS BECOME A REVOLUTIONARY ICON<p></p><p></p>Since his death, posters displaying Che’s portrait have appeared in al-most every major city in the world. The Che on these posters and plac-ards is a heroic figure, with the unmistakable beard, beret, and piercing eyes that have come to be associated with this legendary revolutionary. In many of these mass-produced portraits of Che, the heroic face that peers out from them somehow seems to combine in one human counte-nance all the races of mankind. His eyes and mustache appear Asiatic,<p></p><p></p>

CHE’S ENDURING LEGACY	195
<p></p>while the darkness of his complexion seems African, and the shape of his nose and cheeks are distinctively European. Perhaps this partially ex-plains why he has become an icon for radical political activists, guerrillas, rebels, leftist students, and intellectuals on every continent, and why, for example, his face is often the only white one to appear alongside those of nonwhite revolutionary heroes in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.<p></p><p></p>Following his death, in the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s left-ist students, radical intellectuals, and revolutionary movements around the world constantly quoted Che’s famous dictum “The duty of every revolutionary is to make the revolution.” They believed, as did Che, revolutions are made by people who are willing to act, not by those who are waiting for the appropriate objective conditions or for orders from the offi cial Communist Party or the leaders of the Soviet Union or China. It is interesting in this regard to note the official Communist press in the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, and the People’s Republic of China during the 1970s and 1980s often referred to the young leftists in these radical student and political movements as “Guevarist hippies” and “left-wing adventurers.” However, such attacks were a matter of little importance to these movements, since they regarded Guevara’s activist revolutionary ideas as an alternative to the overly dogmatic and bureaucratic party lines of the more orthodox Communists who were in power in the Soviet Union and China and to the tepid reform-ism of the moderate socialist and social democratic parties in Western Europe and elsewhere.<p></p><p></p>Because of his undaunted and fi ercely independent revolutionary idealism, Che became the idol of the New Left during the late 1960s and 1970s in the United States and Great Britain, the bulwarks of capi-talism and bourgeois democracy. For a time, students at the London School of Economics and Political Science, one of the most hallowed of Britain’s institutions of higher education, greeted each other with the salutation “Che.” In the United States, buttons, shirts, placards, and posters with Che’s face were present at nearly every antiwar demonstra-tion during the Vietnam War years. Signifi cantly, they have appeared again in the protests against the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.<p></p><p></p>In Latin America, where Che gave his life fi ghting for ideals, his name became a battle cry among leftist students, intellectuals, and workers during the 1970s and 1980s.

Che truly belongs in the pantheon of the region’s most famous revolutionary leaders—José Martí, Augusto César Sandino, Emiliano Zapata, Pancho Villa, Camilo Torres, and Fidel Castro.<p></p><p></p>CHE’S LEGACY IN CUBA<p></p><p></p>In Cuba, Che holds one of the highest positions in Cuba’s pantheon of revolutionary heroes and martyrs. Less than a week after Fidel Castro acknowledged Che had indeed been killed by the Bolivian military, hundreds of thousands of Cubans silently fi lled Havana’s Plaza de la Revolución to listen tearfully to Castro as he told dozens of anecdotes about Che and praised Che’s outstanding intellectual, political, and military virtues. Backed by a huge portrait of Che and flanked by Cuban<p></p><p></p>fl ags, Castro gave notice of the importance the Cuban regime would give in the future to Che’s revolutionary example. Near the end of his tribute to his fallen comrade, Castro said:<p></p> 
CHE’S ENDURING LEGACY	197
<p></p>If we ask ourselves how we want our revolutionary fi ghters, our militants, and our people to be, then we must answer without any hesitation: let them be like Che! If we wish to express how we want the people of future generations to be, we must say: let them be like Che! If we ask how we desire to educate our children, we should say without hesitation: we want our children to be educated in the spirit of Che! (Deutschmann 1994:78)<p></p><p></p>Today, the Cuban regime continues to educate the youth of the coun-try about Che. His picture is in every Cuban school, and Cuba’s school-children learn by heart quotations from his writings and his letters. All know the stirring hymn “Seremos como el Che” (We will be like Che), which is sung on many occasions.<p></p>Several generations of Cubans also know this famous paragraph from<p></p><p></p>Che’s farewell letter to his children:<p></p><p></p>Remember that the revolution is what is most important and that each one of us, alone, is worth nothing.

(Deutschmann 1997:349)<p></p><p></p>Part of his legacy is his children. With his fi rst wife, Hilda Gadea, he had a daughter, Hilda Beatriz Guevara Gadea, born February 15, 1956, in Mexico City (she died of cancer August 21, 1995, in Havana, Cuba, at the age of 39). With his second wife, Aleida March, he had four chil-dren: Aleida Guevara March, born November 24, 1960, in Havana; Camilo Guevara March, born May 20, 1962, in Havana; Celia Guevara March, born June 14, 1963, in Havana; and Ernesto Guevara March, born February 24, 1965, in Havana.<p></p><p></p>His daughter Aleida is a medical doctor and an important Cuban po-litical figure in her own right. She represents the family at most public functions. His sons Camilo and Ernesto are lawyers, and his daughter Celia is a veterinarian and marine biologist who works with dolphins and sea lions. Among them they have eight children, Che’s grandchil-dren. It is also rumored Che had another child from an alleged extra-marital relationship with Lilia Rosa López, and this child is supposedly Omar Pérez, born in Havana March 19, 1964 (Castañeda 1998:264–65).<p></p><p></p>For a regime that wishes to instill a revolutionary socialist and in-ternationalist consciousness in its young, there is no better example than Che. His revolutionary ideals and personal example have become part of the social consciousness of several generations of Cubans. And he remains the Cuban model for the 21st-century socialist—“the new human being who is to be glimpsed on the horizon,” which he wrote about in his now famous essay “Socialism and Man” (1965).<p></p><p></p>Elsewhere, Che has also become a pop hero. In the United States, western Europe, and Latin America his image has become commercial-ized through the marketing of shirts, handkerchiefs, music albums, CD covers, posters, beer, ash trays, jeans, watches, and even towels imprinted with his picture or name. As a pop or commercialized hero fi gure, Che is often depicted in a sardonic or satirical manner. In this commercial-ized iconic image he is not the heroic revolutionary fi gure the Cuban leaders and his contemporary admirers hold up as the model of the 21st-century human being; rather, he is a humorous or satirical caricature. For his family and friends as well as those who admire Che as a heroic<p></p> 
CHE’S ENDURING LEGACY	199
<p></p>revolutionary, the use of his famous image to market products in the capitalist marketplace is just as denigrating as the image of Che held by his avowed enemies, who regard him as a fanatical killer, a psychopath, or a sinister Communist renegade.<p></p>The phenomenon of hero worship and the process by which individu-als become popular heroes have always been something of a mystery. In all times and places there appears to be a need for heroes. However, in times of great change, this need seems greatest. Today, people around the globe see their societies and humanity in general undergoing far-reaching changes. Many find their lives adversely affected by these changes and are frightened about the future that these changes may bring, while oth-ers hope for significant improvements in society and the quality of their own lives through radical changes in the existing order. Both groups ap-pear to need the assurance that human beings can control their fate and shape the future according to their desires. They sometimes fi nd this assurance in the words and deeds of an exceptional individual, whose courage and individual efforts to shape the future according to his or her ideals, even if seemingly unsuccessful, give them inspiration. This ap-pears to be one of the reasons Che continues to be such a popular hero.<p></p><p></p>Che had the courage to act in accordance with his ideals. He gave his life fighting for a brave new world that he believed he could help bring into being. It is little wonder he is admired for this. As a Latin American Catholic priest I met in Bolivia said shortly after Che’s death: “To pass one’s life in the jungle, ill clothed and starving, with a price on his head, confronting the military power of imperialism, and on top of that, sick with asthma, exposing himself to death by suffocation if the bullets did not cut him down first, a man, who could have lived regally, with money, amusements, friends, women, and vices in any of the great cities of sin; this is heroism, true heroism, no matter how confused or wrong his ideas might have been. Not to recognize this is not only re-actionary, but stupid.”<p></p><p></p>Che’s exceptional devotion to the realization of his ideals was truly heroic, and indeed it would be foolish not to recognize this. Those who recognize the heroism in his character and actions cannot help admiring Che, regardless of whether they agree with his revolutionary politics and utopian ideals. Che continues to be a hero for all those who admire and are inspired by his idealism and his exceptional human courage.<p></p> 
200	CHE GUEVARA<p></p><p></p>EL HOMBRE NUEVO—THE NEW HUMAN BEING<p></p><p></p>Che’s vision of the new human being (el hombre nuevo) inspired not only him and his comrades but also the young Bolivian revolutionaries who followed in his footsteps a few years after his death. After escaping the Bolivian military’s efforts to hunt down the last survivors of Che’s guerrilla force, Inti Peredo and Darío (a Bolivian whose real name was David Adriazola) went into hiding in the jungles of northern Bolivia. There they organized another guerrilla force to continue the struggle initiated by Che (Siles del Valle 1996:38 – 40). However, this guerrilla force was short lived and in 1969 both Inti and Darío were caught and killed in the Bolivian capital city of La Paz. Thus, they too sacrificed their lives fighting, like Che and their former comrades, for a new soci-ety and a new kind of human being.<p></p><p></p>During this period, Che’s concept of el hombre nuevo and many of his other revolutionary ideals found sympathy among many of the adher-ents of an unorthodox Christian body of theory and practice know as Liberation Theology (Boff and Boff 1988). In the 1960s and 1970s, this body of socially concerned and unorthodox religious views gained sig-nificant support among the more progressive elements of the Catholic Church in Latin America. Many of its adherents established close links with the revolutionary movements in the region. And in some cases the most progressive sectors of the Church, influenced by the ideals of Liberation Theology, joined radical Marxist and neo-Marxist political movements in Bolivia and in other countries such as Chile, Peru, Brazil, Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Guatemala.<p></p><p></p>After the deaths of Inti Peredo and Darío, this convergence of views resulted in the participation of some of the younger members of Bolivia’s Christian Democratic Party in a revolutionary guerrilla movement that called itself the Ejército de Liberación Nacional (National Liberation Army), the same name used by Che’s group. This movement was led by none other than Osvaldo “Chato” Peredo, the younger brother of Inti and Coco Peredo (Siles del Valle 1996:40 – 43). In 1970 this move-ment attempted to establish a guerrilla foco near the mining town of Teoponte, north of the capital of La Paz. They were quickly surrounded and defeated by the Bolivian army, and in a totally unnecessary act of brutality many of them were massacred by the army after they offered<p></p> 
CHE’S ENDURING LEGACY	201
<p></p>to surrender. Only a few survived, largely as a result of the intervention of the local leaders of the Catholic Church. Chato Peredo, who is now a psychotherapist in La Paz, was one of the few survivors who were imprisoned and later released (Anderson 1997:745).<p></p>After the massacre by the Bolivian army of most of the young par-ticipants in the Teoponte guerrilla foco, an important change began to take place in Bolivian popular culture and politics. Although the idea of guerrilla warfare was rejected as a viable form of resistance to the military regime, important elements within Bolivian society began to idealize and even venerate Che and the other fallen guerrillas as mar-tyrs (Siles del Valle 1996:44 – 45). Che’s death, his concept of the new human being, the ideals of Liberation Theology, the deaths of so many idealistic young Bolivians in the revolutionary movements inspired by Che and his comrades—all these elements combined to exert a major infl uence on Bolivian popular culture, literature, and politics that has continued to this day. It is even possible to speak today of the sanctifi - cation of the guerrillas in the minds of many people in Bolivia.<p></p><p></p><p></p>SIGNIFICANCE AND EFFECTS OF<p></p><p></p>CHE’S FAILED BOLIVIAN MISSION<p></p><p></p>Indeed, the death of Che Guevara and the failure of his guerrilla opera-tion in Bolivia have not stopped attempts to bring about meaningful change in the region through armed revolution. In fact, Che’s failure helped to clarify what is needed to organize a successful armed insurrec-tion against an unjust and oppressive regime. Subsequent revolutionary movements have appeared in Latin America and in other parts of the world since Che’s death, and in most cases they have taken into account the importance of mobilizing mass political support for their move-ments in urban as well as rural areas.<p></p><p></p>The revolutionary movements that occurred in Central America during the late 1970s and 1980s were founded on this approach. Since the 1990s the Zapatista revolutionary movement in southern Mexico, described in chapter 6, and the Bolivarian revolution in Venezuela (led by that country’s leftist president Hugo Chávez Frías) have been based on mass political support organized in both urban and rural areas. Sig-nifi cantly, they frequently give homage to Che’s revolutionary legacy.<p></p> 
202	CHE GUEVARA<p></p><p></p>Che’s failed mission in Bolivia proved, among other things, that a well-trained and committed revolutionary guerrilla force is not sufficient to detonate a successful revolution. Che’s Bolivian operation demon-strated that unless an armed movement mobilizes popular support among the middle and working classes in urban areas as well as poorer sectors of the rural population it will be isolated and wiped out by government troops using what are now commonly understood counterinsurgency tactics. In other words, the creation of a popular-based, multiclass revo-lutionary movement is widely regarded today as the basic prerequisite for a successful popular revolution. It is, of course, far more diffi cult to create than a guerrilla foco in a relatively isolated rural area, but it is not outside the realm of possibility in the present global order. In fact, this type of popular-based revolutionary movement has emerged in recent years in various parts of the world (in Latin America, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia) and will surely emerge again in the near future.<p></p><p></p>As the preceding discussion seeks to make clear, Che’s death and the failure of his guerrilla operation in Bolivia have enriched the interna-tional pool of revolutionary theory and practice. The lessons learned from the failure of his movement have led many revolutionary or re-bellious political and social groups around the world to develop more successful strategies for gaining power. Moreover, as a result of Che’s willingness to die for his revolutionary ideals and his martyrdom in the pursuit of these ideals, he has become a universal model of revolutionary courage and commitment, and his example continues to inspire new generations of revolutionaries and leftist political activists around the world.<p></p><p></p>More than four decades have passed since Che Guevara was killed in the little village of La Higuera in Bolivia. However, the social injustices against which this famous revolutionary fought—fi rst in the Cuban revolution, then in the Congo, and finally in Bolivia—are very much in existence today. For this reason, Che’s revolutionary life and death continue to inspire those who struggle against these injustices, particu-larly in Latin America.<p></p><p></p>Che’s revolutionary legacy can be found in the words and deeds of workers, poor peasants, middle-class university students, intellectuals, shantytown dwellers, the leaders of indigenous communities, and the landless and the homeless —from the tip of Argentina to Mexico’s bor-<p></p> 
CHE’S ENDURING LEGACY	203
<p></p>der with the United States, from the Andean valleys of Peru and Bolivia to the cities and vast Amazonian region of Brazil, and of course every-where in Cuba. Che is the focus of hundreds of books and articles, as well as films, paintings, sculptures, and murals, in Europe, North Amer-ica, South America, Africa, and Asia. Today his face and name are known throughout the world, and his revolutionary legacy has acquired an en-during global significance. In particular, the shift to the left in contem-porary Latin American politics has created renewed interest in Che’s revolutionary ideals, his struggle against social injustice and his dedica-tion to the revolutionary unifi cation of Latin America.<p></p><p></p>As his first wife, Hilda Gadea (2008:21–22), wrote in her book about Che, for many people around the world he is the “exemplary revolu-tionary” and “a man of principle whose true understanding is essential to the struggle for justice in Latin America and other parts of the world.” They see him as an “example for the young generation of the Americas and the world” to follow because of “his faith in mankind, his love for the dispossessed, and his total commitment to the struggle against ex-ploitation and poverty.”<p></p> 
<p></p> 
<p></p><p></p>Chapter 13<p></p><p></p>¡CHE VIVE!—CHE’S CONTINUING INFLUENCE IN LATIN AMERICA<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>In Latin America, Che is as politically important today as he was when he died in Bolivia over four decades ago. In some ways he is even more important now. In recent years there has been a dramatic shift to the left in the politics of most Latin American countries. This shift in the political orientation of this important region of the world has given rise to renewed interest in Che Guevara’s ideals of Pan-American unity, anti-imperialism, and humanist socialism.<p></p><p></p>This rather remarkable change of direction in the region’s politics is largely in response to the failure of the neoliberal agenda of free-market and free-trade capitalism pursued by the U.S. government, the Inter-national Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the Inter-American De-velopment Bank, and most of the governments of the region since the 1980s. The neoliberal economic and social policies promoted by these Washington-based institutions (often referred to as the Washington Consensus) have widened the gap between the rich and the poor, while they have denationalized the economies and privatized the governments of most of the countries in the region. The tidal wave of popular op-position to these neoliberal policies and to the adverse effects of the ac-companying globalization of these societies (i.e., the denationalization of<p></p> 
206	CHE GUEVARA<p></p><p></p>their economies so that they can be more effectively integrated into the expanding global capitalist system) has generated new political move-ments and new populist leaders who openly identify with Che Guevara’s ideals and his revolutionary struggle.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>CHE AND CONTEMPORARY<p></p><p></p>BOLIVIAN POLITICS<p></p><p></p>There is no better example of Che’s influence than Bolivia. After suffering for decades under U.S.-backed right-wing governments, which imposed neoliberal policies that adversely affected the majority of the population, the country’s largely indigenous population has risen up in opposition and found its political voice. The political mobilization of the poor ma-jority of the country led to the election in the fall of 2005 of Bolivia’s leftist president Juan “Evo” Morales, who won the election with some 54 percent of the votes. Popularly known as Evo, he is of indigenous de-scent (Aymará) and is the leader of the Movimiento al Socialismo (MAS, or Movement toward Socialism). As previously mentioned in chapter 11, Antonio Peredo—the oldest brother of Coco, Inti, and Chato Peredo— and Loyola Guzman, who was a member of the urban support network for Che’s guerrilla force in Bolivia, are prominent members of MAS, as are many other leftist intellectuals, workers, and peasants in Bolivia.<p></p><p></p>Morales is the first person from Bolivia’s indigenous majority to lead the country since the Spanish conquest subjugated the indigenous popu-lation 500 years ago. He and the other leaders of MAS are outspoken admirers of Che Guevara. They have placed photos of Che in the na-tional parliament building and a portrait of Che made from local coca leaves in the presidential offices. The MAS-led government has initi-ated a constitutional revision of the country’s governmental system, an agrarian reform program, and nationalization of the country’s mining and natural gas industries. Thus, the Morales government is reversing the direction of Bolivia’s economic, social, and political development. Instead of privatization of public services and denationalization of the economy, the country’s new leadership is committed to regaining na-tional control over the country’s mining and natural gas industries and using the revenues from these industries to finance a people-centered,<p></p> 
¡CHE VIVE!	207
<p></p>equitable, and environmentally sustainable program of social and eco-nomic development.<p></p>Before his official inauguration as president of Bolivia on January 22, 2006, Morales went to the archaeological site and spiritual center of Ti-wanaku, the capital of one of the most ancient cultures in the world, where he was crowned the honorary supreme leader of the Aymará and was given gifts from representatives of indigenous peoples from all over the Americas. In the speech that he gave at the La Puerta del Sol, or the Door of the Sun, which is the gateway into the ancient temple of Kalasasaya, Morales said that “the struggle that Che Guevara left un-completed, we shall complete” (Granma January 23, 2006). Afterward, in the speech he gave at his inauguration, he included Che among the fallen heroes in the 500-year struggle of his people for their freedom.<p></p><p></p>Even more significant is that Morales went to La Higuera, where Che was killed, to celebrate Che’s 78th birthday on June 14, 2006. He is the first Bolivian head of state to have ever visited the village and he chose this date to pay tribute to Che, to officially open the medical center the government of Cuba donated to the village, and to congratulate the local graduates of the literacy program Yes I Can, which has been advised and equipped by the Cuban government. Che’s son Camilo Guevara was present as well as the Cuban ambassador to Bolivia and a number of Cuban doctors in their white coats. Morales pledged Bolivia’s solidarity with Cuba and Venezuela and said he would be willing to take up arms to defend them if they are attacked by the United States (Delacour 2006). Hugo Moldiz, a journalist who is the coordinator of the political front of some 30 different popular organizations that support Morales’s govern-ment, told the press that the medical clinic and the literacy program demonstrated the relevance of Che’s revolutionary struggle, since one of the reasons he gave his life fighting in Bolivia was to ensure that the Bo-livian people had access to adequate health care and education (Mayoral and González 2006).<p></p><p></p>Accompanied by Bolivian government officials and the Cuban am-bassador, President Morales also went to inaugurate the installation of modern medical equipment at the Vallegrande hospital—the same hos-pital where Che was last seen before his body was secretly buried near the airstrip in Vallegrande. Today, the laundry building where Che’s body was laid out for examination and where the last photos were taken of<p></p>

Cony Jaro.<p></p><p></p><p></p>him has become a shrine in his memory. Morales’s visit to La Higuera and Vallegrande as the Bolivian head of state is the first time that any high government official in Bolivia has paid tribute to Che Guevara and his guerrilla mission in Bolivia. Moldiz, who has close ties to Cuba, told the press that Morales’s tribute to Che was consistent with the path of Morales’s own struggle and with the identification of his government with the ideals of Che.<p></p><p></p>CHE AND CONTEMPORARY POLITICS<p></p><p></p>IN VENEZUELA AND ECUADOR<p></p><p></p>Che’s ideas about the need to create new human beings guided by so-cialist morality and his critique of bureaucratism have found particular resonance in Venezuela today (Munckton 2007). The regime of Hugo Chávez has widely distributed copies of the critical essay Che wrote on bureaucratism while he was a minister in the Cuban government. But even though Chávez has pointed to Cuba as an important source of in-spiration, he has emphasized that Venezuela will have to create its own form of socialism to fit its particular history and conditions. The empha-sis on direct democracy in Venezuela is consistent with this perspective,<p></p> 
¡CHE VIVE!	209
<p></p>and Chávez contends that the only way to overcome poverty is to give power to the poor. Thus, he and his supporters contend that the Bolivar-ian revolution will create a democratic, humanist socialism rather than the bureaucratic, authoritarian style of so-called socialism that existed in the Soviet Union. It is in this context that Che’s revolutionary legacy has found the most fertile soil in Venezuela and Bolivia today. His writ-ings, his deeds in the Cuban Revolution and his personal sacrifice in the struggle for human liberation and social justice are a source of great inspiration and guidance to the Venezuelans and the Bolivians who are struggling for these same ideals today.<p></p><p></p>In Ecuador, Che is also held in high esteem. Much like Chávez and Morales, the country’s new leftist president Rafael Correa Delgado laced his acceptance speech on January 15, 2007, with references to Simón Bolívar and Che Guevara. He said his country needs to build a 21st-century socialism to overcome the poverty, inequality, and political instability that have plagued the Ecuadorian people. Both Chávez and Morales were special guests at Correa’s inauguration. With them at his side, Correa said: “Latin America isn’t living an era of changes”; rather, “it’s living a change of eras” and “the long night of neoliberalism is com-ing to an end” (Fertl 2007). Che would have been happy indeed to hear what Correa said afterward. He said: “A sovereign, dignified, just and so-cialist Latin America is beginning to rise.” Exactly the kind of language Che used four decades earlier.<p></p><p></p><p></p>CHE’S CONTEMPORARY POPULARITY<p></p><p></p>OUTSIDE LATIN AMERICA<p></p><p></p>Critical observers of Che’s contemporary popularity in North America, Europe, and other regions outside Latin America are quick to point out that his iconic image has become a global brand, often devoid of any ideological or political significance when it is used to market certain products. They dismiss his continuing appeal to youth as merely a case of “adolescent revolutionary romanticism” and radical chic (O’Hagan 2004). However, while it is true Che’s image has become quite profit-able and is used to market a wide variety of goods to young people in the United States and elsewhere, his image still has political significance. Consequently, his image was removed from a CD carrying case recently in the United States after it sparked significant criticism in the media,<p></p> 
210	CHE GUEVARA<p></p><p></p>in which Che was compared with Osama bin Laden and Adolf Hitler (Reyes 2006). Target Corporation, the large retail company that distrib-uted the product in question, felt compelled to withdraw it from sale and issue a public apology for selling the item. This incident is proof that Che’s supposedly apolitical iconic image still has too much political sig-nificance for many shoppers in the global capitalist shopping mall.<p></p><p></p>Moreover, even in the United States, the center of global capitalism, Che still finds political admirers. When asked several years ago why his father is perceived as a devil by American corporations and believers in the free market, Che’s son Camilo accurately pointed out that “he is a devil for the U.S. government and American multinationals” but that “many North Americans admire and respect El Che” and “they fight injustice in American society under his banner” (HUMO 1998). Thus, one sees Che Guevara images along the U.S.-Mexico border as manifes-tations of activism. Although Che Guevara was not Mexican, his image has been appropriated by activists in the Mexican community within the United States who seek more access to education and civil rights, and the use of his image can be seen as a critique of current U.S. immigration policy. Camilo also correctly noted that there are people in the United<p></p><p></p>

<p></p>States who declare their solidarity with Cuba and seek to lift the U.S.<p></p><p></p>economic blockade against his country.<p></p><p></p>Prominent public intellectuals such as Régis Debray in France, Jorge Castañeda in Mexico, Alvaro Vargas Llosa in Peru (son of the famous novelist Mario Vargas Llosa), Pacho O’Donnell in Argentina, and others have done their best to demystify and dismiss the significance of the en-during popularity of Che, particularly among young people. One of the most representative members of this group of critics is the British-born liberal savant Christopher Hitchens, who supported the Cuban revolu-tion in the 1960s but has since called himself a recovering Marxist. In a 1997 review article of Jon Lee Anderson’s biography of Che and Che’s posthumously published The Motorcycle Diaries Hitchens argued that Che’s enduring popularity is a contemporary case of classic romantic idol-atry. In what has become a familiar argument among intellectuals in the United States and Europe for dismissing Che’s iconic popularity, Hitch-ens asserts that “Che’s iconic status was assured because he failed. His story was one of defeat and isolation, and that’s why it is so seductive. Had he lived, the myth of Che would have long since died” (Hitchens 1997).<p></p><p></p>Thus, Hitchens and other intellectuals who share his perspective claim Che “belongs more to the romantic tradition than the revolu-tionary one,” since “to endure as a romantic icon, one must not just die young, but die hopelessly” and, according to Hitchens, “Che fulfils both criteria.” However, there is a fundamental factual inaccuracy and a false premise in this thesis. Che did not die young. Someone who dies at 39 is hardly young (except to those over 50). His death was untimely to be sure, but he was not young when he died. Furthermore, Hitchens and the other intellectual demystifiers of Che’s iconic popularity fail to compre-hend the continuing political and ideological significance of his iconic legacy.<p></p><p></p>The waving banners, the graffiti on the walls, the posters, the T-shirts, the videos, the films, the books, the pamphlets, the photos, the songs, the tattoos, and the cries of “¡Che Vive!” on the lips of people around the world provide overwhelming evidence that Che Guevara represents a powerful symbol of one of the most outstanding examples in modern history of resistance to injustice, inequality, exploitation, and political domination. And this is true for people literally around the world. Che continues to be a popular hero for many people—of all ages—for the<p></p> 
212	CHE GUEVARA<p></p><p></p>same reason that Bolivia’s President Evo Morales, in his late 40s, says he admires Che: “I admire Che because he fought for equality and for justice,” and “he did not just care for ordinary people, he made their struggle his own” (Rieff 2005).<p></p>As art historian Trisha Ziff has astutely noted: “Che’s iconic image mysteriously reappears whenever there’s a conflict over injustice [and] there isn’t anything else in history that serves in this way” (Lotz 2006). More than anything else, as Ziff acknowledges, Che is a symbol of op-position to imperialism and “in the end, you cannot take this meaning out of the image.” Ziff is correct in asserting that the meaning of Che’s image is that of the guerrillero heroico—the heroic guerrilla fighter against imperialism, and particularly U.S. imperialism.<p></p><p></p><p></p>CHE’S INFLUENCE ON CONTEMPORARY<p></p><p></p>LATIN AMERICAN POLITICS<p></p><p></p>But in contemporary Latin America, Che is more than a powerful sym-bol of resistance to U.S. imperialism; his values and many of his ideas continue to be extremely relevant to the current political reality and the shift to the left in Latin American politics. His views and revolutionary life are finding increasing resonance among the new political leaders, new political movements, and rank-and-file political activists in the re-gion. They find Che’s vision of a socialist future and his ideas about how to get there to be directly relevant to their efforts to end the region’s tragic pathology of distorted, neocolonial, and unequal development. Che’s ideals and vision of a united, free, and socialist Latin America are a source of inspiration for their pursuit of emancipatory, equitable, and sustainable alternatives to the disempowering, inequitable, and unsus-tainable structures and values of 21st-century global capitalism. Che is much more than a popular symbol of uncompromising defiance to in-justice and imperial domination; his revolutionary vision of the future and ideas about how to wage the struggle to get there are relevant to the contemporary efforts being made to bring about a revolutionary trans-formation of the basic economic, political, and social structures in Latin America and the Caribbean.<p></p><p></p>As a sign of how times have changed in the region, a little more than a month after President Evo Morales paid a historic tribute to Che Gue-<p></p>

<p></p>vara in La Higuera and Vallegrande, a similar unprecedented event took place in nearby Argentina. It will most likely become a legend of its own. Following an important meeting in Córdoba, Argentina, of the MERCOSUR (Southern Common Market) to which Cuba was invited and Venezuela was accepted as a new member, Hugo Chávez and Fidel Castro made a historic pilgrimage to Alta Gracia to tour Che’s boyhood home (Adn mundo.com 2006).<p></p><p></p>Since 2001 the middle-class house, now called Villa Nydia, where Che lived as a boy has served as a museum dedicated to his memory. On July 22, 2006, almost four decades after Che’s death, two of the most im-portant heads of state in Latin America paid a highly publicized visit to Che’s boyhood home. When they arrived, the waiting crowd of several thousand people responded with a chorus of chants: “Fidel, Fidel, Hugo, Hugo” and “¡Se siente! ¡Se siente! ¡Guevara está presente!”—“One feels it! One feels it! Guevara is present!” (Rey 2006).<p></p><p></p>As they emerged from their vehicles, the two heads of state waved to the crowd and stopped at the entrance to the house in front of a bronze statue of Che modeled after a photograph taken when he was eight years old. They admired the statue and then went inside for an emotional en-counter with the memorabilia of Che’s boyhood and family life. Castro was surprised to learn that Che’s parents rented the house, and he asked how much rent they had paid (Adnmundo.com 2006). When the director of the museum said she really didn’t know, Castro jokingly reproached her for not knowing this important fact. At one point, Castro broke down and cried in front of a large picture of Che’s mother Celia with her young children around her, including the young Che. Then, Castro and Chávez met with some of Che’s childhood friends who were waiting in the house, including Calica Ferrer, who accompanied Che on his trip to Bolivia and Peru in 1953. Castro and Chávez viewed Che’s birth certifi-cate, handwritten letters, and a motorbike like the one he rode around Argentina. Ariel Vidoza, a childhood friend of Che, answered some of Castro’s questions about Che’s childhood. Among the answers she gave, she said: “Ernesto didn’t like the rich much. He preferred to play with us, the poor ones” (Rey 2006).<p></p><p></p>As they left the house they posed for photographs with Che’s boy-hood friends in front of the statue of the young Ernesto. To the reporters waiting outside, Chávez said with a great deal of emotion in his voice: “I<p></p> 
214	CHE GUEVARA<p></p><p></p>came to feed my soul. I am leaving with the batteries of my soul charged for 80 more years of revolutionary struggle and battles” (Venezolana de Televisión 2006). With tears in his eyes, Castro told the reporters and the crowd that he was sorry he and Chávez could not stay longer and waved to the onlookers, who were clapping and cheering.<p></p><p></p>No one could possibly have imagined such an event 40 years ago, even 10 years ago. It was a historic scene: Che’s comrade in arms, the famous 20th-century revolutionary leader Fidel Castro (80 years old at the time), and Hugo Chávez, one of Latin America’s new 21st-century revolutionary leaders, standing shoulder to shoulder in front of Che’s boyhood home, which is now a museum of the revolutionary life of the legendary Che Guevara. There they stood in Alta Gracia (High Grace), Argentina, surrounded by a cheering crowd of thousands in Che’s home-land, where not too many years earlier a bloody military dictatorship had ruthlessly disappeared anyone thought to be sympathizers of Guevara and Castro.<p></p><p></p>As the caravan of cars carrying Fidel Castro and Hugo Chávez left Alta Gracia for Córdoba, they passed a building in Che’s hometown where<p></p><p></p>

<p></p>someone had written on the wall in bold red letters: “¡Che Vive!” (Che Lives!) There are similar Che Vive slogans on the walls of the laundry building in Vallegrande, Bolivia, where Che’s half-nude body was dis-played after he was killed over 40 years ago (O’Hagan 2004). What the visit of Fidel Castro and Hugo Chávez to Che’s boyhood home in Alta Gracia, Ecuadorian President Correa’s televised comments, and the Che Vive slogans on walls in many parts of Latin America and the world reflect is what his wife, Aleida March, wrote in her foreword to Che’s Congo diary (Guevara, March, and Gott 2000:l): “Men do not die when their life and example can serve as a guide to others, and when those others succeed in continuing their work.”<p></p>

The following selected list of print and electronic sources on Che Guevara is targeted primarily at secondary school and undergradu-ate students and secondarily at a broader audience of people who know very little about Che Guevara but are interested in knowing more.<p></p><p></p>There are three major biographies of Che Guevara, all three written during the late 1990s. They are as follows:<p></p><p></p>Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life by Jon Lee Anderson (New<p></p><p></p>York: Grove Press, 1997, new edition 2010), 814 pages.<p></p><p></p>Compañero: The Life and Death of Che Guevara by Jorge G.<p></p><p></p>Castañeda (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1997), 456 pages.<p></p><p></p>Ernesto Guevara, Also Known as Che by Paco Ignacio Taibo II, 2nd ed. (New York: St. Martin’s Griffi n, 1999), 704 pages.<p></p><p></p>These three biographies are now somewhat out of date because of new information about the discovery of Che’s hidden remains in Bolivia,<p></p> 
224	FURTHER READING<p></p><p></p>their transfer to Cuba in 1997, and recent political developments in Latin America that have given a new significance to Che’s revolutionary exam-ple, ideals, and political legacy.<p></p>There is also an interesting book on Che by Fidel Castro with a pre-face by Jesús Montané and an introduction by David Deutschmann: Che: A Memoir by Fidel Castro. It was fi rst published in 1994 and republished in 2000 by Ocean Press (New York). This short book of 168 pages pro-vides a great deal of insight into the relationship that existed between Fidel Castro and Che Guevara from the early days of the Cuban revolu-tionary struggle in the 1950s to Che’s fi nal missions in Africa and Bo-livia in the middle and late 1960s. However, it is essentially a collection of the various speeches given by Fidel about Che over the years since Che’s death and it is not a biography per se.<p></p><p></p>An early biography of Che written in Spanish, El Che Guevara by Hugo Gambini (Buenos Aires: Paidos, 1968), I relied on in writing the first edi-tion (1970) of my book on Che Guevara, Death of a Revolutionary: Che Guevara’s Last Mission (New York: W. W. Norton, 2007). This biography by Gambini has been republished several times in Spanish and has been a best seller. The last reprint was in 2007 by Planeta (Mexico City). An-other biography written about the same time by Che’s erstwhile friend Ricardo Rojo My Friend Che was translated and published in English in 1969 (New York: Grove Press, 1968). Both biographies are now outdated because a great deal of information has been made public over the last few decades about the lesser known aspects of Che’s life, and this infor-mation was not available to the authors of these two books. Neverthe-less, they are important sources of information on Che Guevara’s life.<p></p><p></p>There is Che’s autobiographical publication, The Motorcycle Diaries: A Journey around South America (London: Verso, 1995), which provided the basis for Robert Redford’s very successful film, The Motorcycle Dia-ries, with Gael García Bernal playing the lead role of Che. This fi lm was released in 2007 and is now available in CD and DVD format. However, The Motorcycle Diaries is not a truly comprehensive autobiography of Che Guevara. These lucid and brief narrations and refl ections written while he was traveling around South America in his early 20s bring us into intimate contact with him at an important and formative period in his life and they allow us to travel back in time to meet the man before he became a revolutionary. They do not, however, touch on the rest of his life.<p></p> 
FURTHER READING	225
<p></p>The two books written about Che Guevara by his fi rst and second wives are of great importance. They reveal aspects of his character and his personal life that are not to be found in the other biographies men-tioned above. Hilda Gadea’s My Life with Che was first published in En-glish in 1972, but was republished by Palgrave Macmillan in 2008 with a foreword written about her by her brother Ricardo Gadea. More re-cently, Che’s second wife, Aleida March, published her account of her life with Che under the title of Evocación: Mi Vida al Lado del Che (Bogotá: Espasa, 2008). This memoir has not yet been published in English. Both of these books are fascinating and reveal as much about their remark-able authors as they do about Che.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>ONLINE BIOGRAPHIES AND<p></p><p></p>BIOGRAPHICAL DOCUMENTARIES<p></p><p></p>Other biographies and biographical documentaries on Che are acces-sible on the Internet or in CD/DVD format. They vary in quality and detail and provide a general account of Che’s life, death, writings, and speeches. The following are some of the best examples:<p></p>CHE: Rise and Fall (Che Guevara: The Documentary). This video documentary stars Alberto Granados and Alberto Castellanos and is directed by Eduardo Montes-Bradley.

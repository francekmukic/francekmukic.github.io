II. del <p></p>
    
  Chapter XI<p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> A new Chapter in a novel is something like a new scene in a play; and when I draw up the curtain this time, reader, you must fancy you see a room in the George Inn at Millcote, with such large figured papering on the walls as inn rooms have; such a carpet, such furniture, such orna-ments on the mantelpiece, such prints, including a portrait of George the Third, and another of the Prince of Wales, and a representation of the death of Wolfe. All this is visible to you by the light of an oil lamp hanging from the ceiling, and by that of an excellent fire, near which I sit in my cloak and bonnet; my muff and umbrella lie on the table, and I am warming away the numbness and chill contracted by sixteen hours’ exposure to the rawness of an October day: I left Lowton at four o’clock a.m., and the Millcote town clock<p></p> <p></p> is now just striking eight.<p></p> <p></p> Reader, though I look comfortably accommodated, I am not very tranquil in my mind. I thought when the coach stopped here there would be some one to meet me; I looked anxiously round as I descended the wooden steps the ‘boots’ placed for my convenience, expecting to hear my name pro-nounced, and to see some description of carriage waiting to convey me to Thornfield. Nothing of the sort was visible; and when I asked a waiter if any one had been to inquire after a Miss Eyre, I was answered in the negative: so I had<p></p>  
<p></p> 142	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
no resource but to request to be shown into a private room: and here I am waiting, while all sorts of doubts and fears are troubling my thoughts.<p></p> <p></p> It is a very strange sensation to inexperienced youth to feel itself quite alone in the world, cut adrift from ev-ery connection, uncertain whether the port to which it is bound can be reached, and prevented by many impedi-ments from returning to that it has quitted. The charm of adventure sweetens that sensation, the glow of pride warms it; but then the throb of fear disturbs it; and fear with me became predominant when half- an-hour elapsed and still I was alone. I bethought myself to ring the bell.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Is there a place in this neighbourhood called Thornfield?’ I asked of the waiter who answered the summons.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Thornfield? I don’t know, ma’am; I’ll inquire at the bar.’ He vanished, but reappeared instantly—<p></p> <p></p> ‘Is your name Eyre, Miss?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Yes.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Person here waiting for you.’<p></p> <p></p> I jumped up, took my muff and umbrella, and hastened into the inn- passage: a man was standing by the open door, and in the lamp-lit street I dimly saw a one-horse convey-ance.<p></p> <p></p> ‘This will be your luggage, I suppose?’ said the man rath-er abruptly when he saw me, pointing to my trunk in the passage.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Yes.’ He hoisted it on to the vehicle, which was a sort of car, and then I got in; before he shut me up, I asked him how far it was to Thornfield.<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	143<p></p>  
‘A matter of six miles.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘How long shall we be before we get there?’ ‘Happen an hour and a half.’<p></p> <p></p> He fastened the car door, climbed to his own seat out-side, and we set off. Our progress was leisurely, and gave me ample time to reflect; I was content to be at length so near the end of my journey; and as I leaned back in the comfort-able though not elegant conveyance, I meditated much at my ease.<p></p> <p></p> ‘I suppose,’ thought I, ‘judging from the plainness of the servant and carriage, Mrs. Fairfax is not a very dashing per-son: so much the better; I never lived amongst fine people but once, and I was very miserable with them. I wonder if she lives alone except this little girl; if so, and if she is in any degree amiable, I shall surely be able to get on with her; I will do my best; it is a pity that doing one’s best does not always answer. At Lowood, indeed, I took that resolution, kept it, and succeeded in pleasing; but with Mrs. Reed, I re-member my best was always spurned with scorn. I pray God Mrs. Fairfax may not turn out a second Mrs. Reed; but if she does, I am not bound to stay with her! let the worst come to the worst, I can advertise again. How far are we on our road now, I wonder?’<p></p> <p></p> I let down the window and looked out; Millcote was be-hind us; judging by the number of its lights, it seemed a place of considerable magnitude, much larger than Lowton. We were now, as far as I could see, on a sort of common; but there were houses scattered all over the district; I felt we were in a different region to Lowood, more populous, less<p></p>  
<p></p> 144	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
picturesque; more stirring, less romantic.<p></p> <p></p> The roads were heavy, the night misty; my conductor let his horse walk all the way, and the hour and a half extended, I verify believe, to two hours; at last he turned in his seat and said—<p></p> <p></p> ‘You’re noan so far fro’ Thornfield now.’<p></p> <p></p> Again I looked out: we were passing a church; I saw its low broad tower against the sky, and its bell was tolling a quarter; I saw a narrow galaxy of lights too, on a hillside, marking a village or hamlet. About ten minutes after, the driver got down and opened a pair of gates: we passed through, and they clashed to behind us. We now slowly as-cended a drive, and came upon the long front of a house: candlelight gleamed from one curtained bow-window; all the rest were dark. The car stopped at the front door; it was opened by a maid-servant; I alighted and went in.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Will you walk this way, ma’am?’ said the girl; and I fol-lowed her across a square hall with high doors all round: she ushered me into a room whose double illumination of fire and candle at first dazzled me, contrasting as it did with the darkness to which my eyes had been for two hours inured; when I could see, however, a cosy and agreeable pic-ture presented itself to my view.<p></p> <p></p> A snug small room; a round table by a cheerful fire; an arm-chair high-backed and old-fashioned, wherein sat the neatest imaginable little elderly lady, in widow’s cap, black silk gown, and snowy muslin apron; exactly like what I had fancied Mrs. Fairfax, only less stately and milder looking. She was occupied in knitting; a large cat sat demurely at<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	145<p></p>  
her feet; nothing in short was wanting to complete the beau-ideal of domestic comfort. A more reassuring introduction for a new governess could scarcely be conceived; there was no grandeur to overwhelm, no stateliness to embarrass; and then, as I entered, the old lady got up and promptly and kindly came forward to meet me.<p></p> <p></p> ‘How do you do, my dear? I am afraid you have had a te-dious ride; John drives so slowly; you must be cold, come to the fire.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Mrs. Fairfax, I suppose?’ said I. ‘Yes, you are right: do sit down.’<p></p> <p></p> She conducted me to her own chair, and then began to remove my shawl and untie my bonnet-strings; I begged she would not give herself so much trouble.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Oh, it is no trouble; I dare say your own hands are almost numbed with cold. Leah, make a little hot negus and cut a sandwich or two: here are the keys of the storeroom.’<p></p> <p></p> And she produced from her pocket a most housewifely bunch of keys, and delivered them to the servant.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Now, then, draw nearer to the fire,’ she continued. ‘You’ve brought your luggage with you, haven’t you, my dear?’<p></p> ‘Yes, ma’am.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘I’ll see it carried into your room,’ she said, and bustled out.<p></p> <p></p> ‘She treats me like a visitor,’ thought I. ‘I little expected such a reception; I anticipated only coldness and stiffness: this is not like what I have heard of the treatment of govern-esses; but I must not exult too soon.’<p></p> <p></p> She returned; with her own hands cleared her knit-<p></p>  
<p></p> 146	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
ting apparatus and a book or two from the table, to make room for the tray which Leah now brought, and then her-self handed me the refreshments. I felt rather confused at being the object of more attention than I had ever before re-ceived, and, that too, shown by my employer and superior; but as she did not herself seem to consider she was doing anything out of her place, I thought it better to take her ci-vilities quietly.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Shall I have the pleasure of seeing Miss Fairfax to-night?’ I asked, when I had partaken of what she offered me.<p></p> <p></p> ‘What did you say, my dear? I am a little deaf,’ returned the good lady, approaching her ear to my mouth.<p></p> <p></p> I repeated the question more distinctly.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Miss Fairfax? Oh, you mean Miss Varens! Varens is the name of your future pupil.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Indeed! Then she is not your daughter?’ ‘No,—I have no family.’<p></p> <p></p> I should have followed up my first inquiry, by asking in what way Miss Varens was connected with her; but I recol-lected it was not polite to ask too many questions: besides, I was sure to hear in time.<p></p> <p></p> ‘I am so glad,’ she continued, as she sat down opposite to me, and took the cat on her knee; ‘I am so glad you are come; it will be quite pleasant living here now with a companion. To be sure it is pleasant at any time; for Thornfield is a fine old hall, rather neglected of late years perhaps, but still it is a respectable place; yet you know in winter-time one feels dreary quite alone in the best quarters. I say alone—Leah is a nice girl to be sure, and John and his wife are very decent<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	147<p></p>  
people; but then you see they are only servants, and one can’t converse with them on terms of equality: one must keep them at due distance, for fear of losing one’s authority. I’m sure last winter (it was a very severe one, if you recollect, and when it did not snow, it rained and blew), not a crea-ture but the butcher and postman came to the house, from November till February; and I really got quite melancholy with sitting night after night alone; I had Leah in to read to me sometimes; but I don’t think the poor girl liked the task much: she felt it confining. In spring and summer one got on better: sunshine and long days make such a difference; and then, just at the commencement of this autumn, little Adela Varens came and her nurse: a child makes a house alive all at once; and now you are here I shall be quite gay.’<p></p> <p></p> My heart really warmed to the worthy lady as I heard her talk; and I drew my chair a little nearer to her, and ex-pressed my sincere wish that she might find my company as agreeable as she anticipated.<p></p> <p></p> ‘But I’ll not keep you sitting up late to-night,’ said she; ‘it is on the stroke of twelve now, and you have been travelling all day: you must feel tired. If you have got your feet well warmed, I’ll show you your bedroom. I’ve had the room next to mine prepared for you; it is only a small apartment, but I thought you would like it better than one of the large front chambers: to be sure they have finer furniture, but they are so dreary and solitary, I never sleep in them myself.’<p></p> <p></p> I thanked her for her considerate choice, and as I really felt fatigued with my long journey, expressed my readiness to retire. She took her candle, and I followed her from the<p></p>  
<p></p> 148	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
room. First she went to see if the hall-door was fastened; having taken the key from the lock, she led the way upstairs. The steps and banisters were of oak; the staircase window was high and latticed; both it and the long gallery into which the bedroom doors opened looked as if they belonged to a church rather than a house. A very chill and vault- like air pervaded the stairs and gallery, suggesting cheerless ideas of space and solitude; and I was glad, when finally ushered into my chamber, to find it of small dimensions, and fur-nished in ordinary, modern style.<p></p> <p></p> When Mrs. Fairfax had bidden me a kind good-night, and I had fastened my door, gazed leisurely round, and in some measure effaced the eerie impression made by that wide hall, that dark and spacious staircase, and that long, cold gallery, by the livelier aspect of my little room, I re-membered that, after a day of bodily fatigue and mental anxiety, I was now at last in safe haven. The impulse of grat-itude swelled my heart, and I knelt down at the bedside, and offered up thanks where thanks were due; not forgetting, ere I rose, to implore aid on my further path, and the power of meriting the kindness which seemed so frankly offered me before it was earned. My couch had no thorns in it that night; my solitary room no fears. At once weary and con-tent, I slept soon and soundly: when I awoke it was broad day.<p></p> <p></p> The chamber looked such a bright little place to me as the sun shone in between the gay blue chintz window curtains, showing papered walls and a carpeted floor, so unlike the bare planks and stained plaster of Lowood, that my spirits<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	149<p></p>  
rose at the view. Externals have a great effect on the young: I thought that a fairer era of life was beginning for me, one that was to have its flowers and pleasures, as well as its thorns and toils. My faculties, roused by the change of scene, the new field offered to hope, seemed all astir. I cannot precisely define what they expected, but it was something pleasant: not perhaps that day or that month, but at an indefinite fu-ture period.<p></p> <p></p> I rose; I dressed myself with care: obliged to be plain— for I had no article of attire that was not made with extreme simplicity—I was still by nature solicitous to be neat. It was not my habit to be disregardful of appearance or careless of the impression I made: on the contrary, I ever wished to look as well as I could, and to please as much as my want of beauty would permit. I sometimes regretted that I was not handsomer; I sometimes wished to have rosy cheeks, a straight nose, and small cherry mouth; I desired to be tall, stately, and finely developed in figure; I felt it a misfortune that I was so little, so pale, and had features so irregular and so marked. And why had I these aspirations and these re-grets? It would be difficult to say: I could not then distinctly say it to myself; yet I had a reason, and a logical, natural rea-son too. However, when I had brushed my hair very smooth, and put on my black frock—which, Quakerlike as it was, at least had the merit of fitting to a nicety—and adjusted my clean white tucker, I thought I should do respectably enough to appear before Mrs. Fairfax, and that my new pu-pil would not at least recoil from me with antipathy. Having opened my chamber window, and seen that I left all things<p></p>  
<p></p> 150	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
straight and neat on the toilet table, I ventured forth. Traversing the long and matted gallery, I descended the<p></p> <p></p> slippery steps of oak; then I gained the hall: I halted there a minute; I looked at some pictures on the walls (one, I re-member, represented a grim man in a cuirass, and one a lady with powdered hair and a pearl necklace), at a bronze lamp pendent from the ceiling, at a great clock whose case was of oak curiously carved, and ebon black with time and rubbing. Everything appeared very stately and imposing to me; but then I was so little accustomed to grandeur. The hall- door, which was half of glass, stood open; I stepped over the threshold. It was a fine autumn morning; the early sun shone serenely on embrowned groves and still green fields; advancing on to the lawn, I looked up and sur-veyed the front of the mansion. It was three storeys high, of proportions not vast, though considerable: a gentleman’s manor-house, not a nobleman’s seat: battlements round the top gave it a picturesque look. Its grey front stood out well from the background of a rookery, whose cawing tenants were now on the wing: they flew over the lawn and grounds to alight in a great meadow, from which these were sepa-rated by a sunk fence, and where an array of mighty old thorn trees, strong, knotty, and broad as oaks, at once explained the etymology of the mansion’s designation. Far-ther off were hills: not so lofty as those round Lowood, nor so craggy, nor so like barriers of separation from the living world; but yet quiet and lonely hills enough, and seeming to embrace Thornfield with a seclusion I had not expected to find existent so near the stirring locality of Millcote. A little<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	151<p></p>  
hamlet, whose roofs were blent with trees, straggled up the side of one of these hills; the church of the district stood nearer Thornfield: its old tower-top looked over a knoll be-tween the house and gates.<p></p> <p></p> I was yet enjoying the calm prospect and pleasant fresh air, yet listening with delight to the cawing of the rooks, yet surveying the wide, hoary front of the hall, and thinking what a great place it was for one lonely little dame like Mrs. Fairfax to inhabit, when that lady appeared at the door.<p></p> <p></p> ‘What! out already?’ said she. ‘I see you are an early riser.’ I went up to her, and was received with an affable kiss and shake of the hand.<p></p> <p></p> ‘How do you like Thornfield?’ she asked. I told her I liked it very much.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Yes,’ she said, ‘it is a pretty place; but I fear it will be get-ting out of order, unless Mr. Rochester should take it into his head to come and reside here permanently; or, at least, visit it rather oftener: great houses and fine grounds require the presence of the proprietor.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Mr. Rochester!’ I exclaimed. ‘Who is he?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘The owner of Thornfield,’ she responded quietly. ‘Did you not know he was called Rochester?’<p></p> <p></p> Of course I did not—I had never heard of him before; but the old lady seemed to regard his existence as a universally understood fact, with which everybody must be acquainted by instinct.<p></p> <p></p> ‘I thought,’ I continued, ‘Thornfield belonged to you.’ ‘To me? Bless you, child; what an idea! To me! I am only<p></p> <p></p> the housekeeper—the manager. To be sure I am distantly<p></p>  
<p></p> 152	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
related to the Rochesters by the mother’s side, or at least my husband was; he was a clergyman, incumbent of Hay— that little village yonder on the hill—and that church near the gates was his. The present Mr. Rochester’s mother was a Fairfax, and second cousin to my husband: but I never presume on the connection—in fact, it is nothing to me; I consider myself quite in the light of an ordinary housekeep-er: my employer is always civil, and I expect nothing more.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘And the little girl—my pupil!’<p></p> <p></p> ‘She is Mr. Rochester’s ward; he commissioned me to find a governess for her. He intended to have her brought up in—shire, I believe. Here she comes, with her ‘bonne,’ as she calls her nurse.’ The enigma then was explained: this affable and kind little widow was no great dame; but a de-pendant like myself. I did not like her the worse for that; on the contrary, I felt better pleased than ever. The equality between her and me was real; not the mere result of conde-scension on her part: so much the better—my position was all the freer.<p></p> <p></p> As I was meditating on this discovery, a little girl, fol-lowed by her attendant, came running up the lawn. I looked at my pupil, who did not at first appear to notice me: she was quite a child, perhaps seven or eight years old, slightly built, with a pale, small-featured face, and a redundancy of hair falling in curls to her waist.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Good morning, Miss Adela,’ said Mrs. Fairfax. ‘Come and speak to the lady who is to teach you, and to make you a clever woman some day.’ She approached.<p></p> <p></p> ‘C’est le ma gouverante!’ said she, pointing to me, and<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	153<p></p>  
addressing her nurse; who answered— ‘Mais oui, certainement.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Are they foreigners?’ I inquired, amazed at hearing the French language.<p></p> <p></p> ‘The nurse is a foreigner, and Adela was born on the Con-tinent; and, I believe, never left it till within six months ago. When she first came here she could speak no English; now she can make shift to talk it a little: I don’t understand her, she mixes it so with French; but you will make out her meaning very well, I dare say.’<p></p> <p></p> Fortunately I had had the advantage of being taught French by a French lady; and as I had always made a point of conversing with Madame Pierrot as often as I could, and had besides, during the last seven years, learnt a portion of French by heart daily—applying myself to take pains with my accent, and imitating as closely as possible the pro-nunciation of my teacher, I had acquired a certain degree of readiness and correctness in the language, and was not likely to be much at a loss with Mademoiselle Adela. She came and shook hand with me when she heard that I was her governess; and as I led her in to breakfast, I addressed some phrases to her in her own tongue: she replied briefly at first, but after we were seated at the table, and she had ex-amined me some ten minutes with her large hazel eyes, she suddenly commenced chattering fluently.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Ah!’ cried she, in French, ‘you speak my language as well as Mr. Rochester does: I can talk to you as I can to him, and so can Sophie. She will be glad: nobody here understands her: Madame Fairfax is all English. Sophie is my nurse; she<p></p>  
<p></p> 154	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
came with me over the sea in a great ship with a chimney that smoked—how it did smoke!—and I was sick, and so was Sophie, and so was Mr. Rochester. Mr. Rochester lay down on a sofa in a pretty room called the salon, and So-phie and I had little beds in another place. I nearly fell out of mine; it was like a shelf. And Mademoiselle—what is your name?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Eyre—Jane Eyre.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Aire? Bah! I cannot say it. Well, our ship stopped in the morning, before it was quite daylight, at a great city—a huge city, with very dark houses and all smoky; not at all like the pretty clean town I came from; and Mr. Rochester carried me in his arms over a plank to the land, and Sophie came after, and we all got into a coach, which took us to a beau-tiful large house, larger than this and finer, called an hotel. We stayed there nearly a week: I and Sophie used to walk every day in a great green place full of trees, called the Park; and there were many children there besides me, and a pond with beautiful birds in it, that I fed with crumbs.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Can you understand her when she runs on so fast?’ asked Mrs. Fairfax.<p></p> <p></p> I understood her very well, for I had been accustomed to the fluent tongue of Madame Pierrot.<p></p> <p></p> ‘I wish,’ continued the good lady, ‘you would ask her a question or two about her parents: I wonder if she remem-bers them?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Adele,’ I inquired, ‘with whom did you live when you were in that pretty clean town you spoke of?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘I lived long ago with mama; but she is gone to the Holy<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	155<p></p>  
Virgin. Mama used to teach me to dance and sing, and to say verses. A great many gentlemen and ladies came to see mama, and I used to dance before them, or to sit on their knees and sing to them: I liked it. Shall I let you hear me sing now?’<p></p> <p></p> She had finished her breakfast, so I permitted her to give a specimen of her accomplishments. Descending from her chair, she came and placed herself on my knee; then, folding her little hands demurely before her, shaking back her curls and lifting her eyes to the ceiling, she commenced singing a song from some opera. It was the strain of a forsaken lady, who, after bewailing the perfidy of her lover, calls pride to her aid; desires her attendant to deck her in her brightest jewels and richest robes, and resolves to meet the false one that night at a ball, and prove to him, by the gaiety of her demeanour, how little his desertion has affected her.<p></p> <p></p> The subject seemed strangely chosen for an infant singer; but I suppose the point of the exhibition lay in hearing the notes of love and jealousy warbled with the lisp of child-hood; and in very bad taste that point was: at least I thought so.<p></p> <p></p> Adele sang the canzonette tunefully enough, and with the naivete of her age. This achieved, she jumped from my knee and said, ‘Now, Mademoiselle, I will repeat you some poetry.’<p></p> <p></p> Assuming an attitude, she began, ‘La Ligue des Rats: fa-ble de La Fontaine.’ She then declaimed the little piece with an attention to punctuation and emphasis, a flexibility of voice and an appropriateness of gesture, very unusual in-<p></p>  
<p></p> 156	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
deed at her age, and which proved she had been carefully trained.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Was it your mama who taught you that piece?’ I asked. ‘Yes, and she just used to say it in this way: ‘Qu’ avez vous donc? lui dit un de ces rats; parlez!’ She made me lift my hand—so—to remind me to raise my voice at the question.<p></p> <p></p> Now shall I dance for you?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘No, that will do: but after your mama went to the Holy Virgin, as you say, with whom did you live then?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘With Madame Frederic and her husband: she took care of me, but she is nothing related to me. I think she is poor, for she had not so fine a house as mama. I was not long there. Mr. Rochester asked me if I would like to go and live with him in England, and I said yes; for I knew Mr. Rochester before I knew Madame Frederic, and he was always kind to me and gave me pretty dresses and toys: but you see he has not kept his word, for he has brought me to England, and now he is gone back again himself, and I never see him.’<p></p> <p></p> After breakfast, Adele and I withdrew to the library, which room, it appears, Mr. Rochester had directed should be used as the schoolroom. Most of the books were locked up behind glass doors; but there was one bookcase left open containing everything that could be needed in the way of elementary works, and several volumes of light literature, poetry, biography, travels, a few romances, &c. I suppose he had considered that these were all the governess would require for her private perusal; and, indeed, they contented me amply for the present; compared with the scanty pick-ings I had now and then been able to glean at Lowood, they<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	157<p></p>  
seemed to offer an abundant harvest of entertainment and information. In this room, too, there was a cabinet piano, quite new and of superior tone; also an easel for painting and a pair of globes.<p></p> <p></p> I found my pupil sufficiently docile, though disinclined to apply: she had not been used to regular occupation of any kind. I felt it would be injudicious to confine her too much at first; so, when I had talked to her a great deal, and got her to learn a little, and when the morning had advanced to noon, I allowed her to return to her nurse. I then pro-posed to occupy myself till dinner-time in drawing some little sketches for her use.<p></p> <p></p> As I was going upstairs to fetch my portfolio and pen-cils, Mrs. Fairfax called to me: ‘Your morning school-hours are over now, I suppose,’ said she. She was in a room the folding- doors of which stood open: I went in when she ad-dressed me. It was a large, stately apartment, with purple chairs and curtains, a Turkey carpet, walnut-panelled walls, one vast window rich in slanted glass, and a lofty ceiling, nobly moulded. Mrs. Fairfax was dusting some vases of fine purple spar, which stood on a sideboard.<p></p> <p></p> ‘What a beautiful room!’ I exclaimed, as I looked round; for I had never before seen any half so imposing.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Yes; this is the dining-room. I have just opened the win-dow, to let in a little air and sunshine; for everything gets so damp in apartments that are seldom inhabited; the draw-ing-room yonder feels like a vault.’<p></p> <p></p> She pointed to a wide arch corresponding to the window, and hung like it with a Tyrian-dyed curtain, now looped up.<p></p>  
<p></p> 158	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
Mounting to it by two broad steps, and looking through, I thought I caught a glimpse of a fairy place, so bright to my novice-eyes appeared the view beyond. Yet it was merely a very pretty drawing-room, and within it a boudoir, both spread with white carpets, on which seemed laid brilliant garlands of flowers; both ceiled with snowy mouldings of white grapes and vine-leaves, beneath which glowed in rich contrast crimson couches and ottomans; while the orna-ments on the pale Pariain mantelpiece were of sparkling Bohemian glass, ruby red; and between the windows large mirrors repeated the general blending of snow and fire.<p></p> <p></p> ‘In what order you keep these rooms, Mrs. Fairfax!’ said I. ‘No dust, no canvas coverings: except that the air feels chilly, one would think they were inhabited daily.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Why, Miss Eyre, though Mr. Rochester’s visits here are rare, they are always sudden and unexpected; and as I ob-served that it put him out to find everything swathed up, and to have a bustle of arrangement on his arrival, I thought it best to keep the rooms in readiness.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Is Mr. Rochester an exacting, fastidious sort of man?’ ‘Not particularly so; but he has a gentleman’s tastes and<p></p> <p></p> habits, and he expects to have things managed in confor-mity to them.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Do you like him? Is he generally liked?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Oh, yes; the family have always been respected here. Al-most all the land in this neighbourhood, as far as you can see, has belonged to the Rochesters time out of mind.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Well, but, leaving his land out of the question, do you like him? Is he liked for himself?’<p></p>

‘I have no cause to do otherwise than like him; and I believe he is considered a just and liberal landlord by his tenants: but he has never lived much amongst them.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘But has he no peculiarities? What, in short, is his char-acter?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Oh! his character is unimpeachable, I suppose. He is rather peculiar, perhaps: he has travelled a great deal, and seen a great deal of the world, I should think. I dare say he is clever, but I never had much conversation with him.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘In what way is he peculiar?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘I don’t know—it is not easy to describe—nothing strik-ing, but you feel it when he speaks to you; you cannot be always sure whether he is in jest or earnest, whether he is pleased or the contrary; you don’t thoroughly understand him, in short—at least, I don’t: but it is of no consequence, he is a very good master.’<p></p> <p></p> This was all the account I got from Mrs. Fairfax of her employer and mine. There are people who seem to have no notion of sketching a character, or observing and describ-ing salient points, either in persons or things: the good lady evidently belonged to this class; my queries puzzled, but did not draw her out. Mr. Rochester was Mr. Rochester in her eyes; a gentleman, a landed proprietor—nothing more: she inquired and searched no further, and evidently wondered at my wish to gain a more definite notion of his identity.<p></p> <p></p> When we left the dining-room, she proposed to show me over the rest of the house; and I followed her upstairs and downstairs, admiring as I went; for all was well arranged and handsome. The large front chambers I thought espe-<p></p>  
<p></p> 160	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
cially grand: and some of the third- storey rooms, though dark and low, were interesting from their air of antiquity. The furniture once appropriated to the lower apartments had from time to time been removed here, as fashions changed: and the imperfect light entering by their nar-row casement showed bedsteads of a hundred years old; chests in oak or walnut, looking, with their strange carv-ings of palm branches and cherubs’ heads, like types of the Hebrew ark; rows of venerable chairs, high-backed and narrow; stools still more antiquated, on whose cushioned tops were yet apparent traces of half-effaced embroideries, wrought by fingers that for two generations had been coffin-dust. All these relics gave to the third storey of Thornfield Hall the aspect of a home of the past: a shrine of memory. I liked the hush, the gloom, the quaintness of these retreats in the day; but I by no means coveted a night’s repose on one of those wide and heavy beds: shut in, some of them, with doors of oak; shaded, others, with wrought old Eng-lish hangings crusted with thick work, portraying effigies of strange flowers, and stranger birds, and strangest human beings,— all which would have looked strange, indeed, by the pallid gleam of moonlight.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Do the servants sleep in these rooms?’ I asked.<p></p> <p></p> ‘No; they occupy a range of smaller apartments to the back; no one ever sleeps here: one would almost say that, if there were a ghost at Thornfield Hall, this would be its haunt.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘So I think: you have no ghost, then?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘None that I ever heard of,’ returned Mrs. Fairfax, smil-<p></p>

ing.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Nor any traditions of one? no legends or ghost stories?’ ‘I believe not. And yet it is said the Rochesters have been rather a violent than a quiet race in their time: per-haps, though, that is the reason they rest tranquilly in their<p></p> <p></p> graves now.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Yes—‘after life’s fitful fever they sleep well,’’ I muttered. ‘Where are you going now, Mrs. Fairfax?’ for she was mov-ing away.<p></p> <p></p> ‘On to the leads; will you come and see the view from thence?’ I followed still, up a very narrow staircase to the at-tics, and thence by a ladder and through a trap-door to the roof of the hall. I was now on a level with the crow colony, and could see into their nests. Leaning over the battlements and looking far down, I surveyed the grounds laid out like a map: the bright and velvet lawn closely girdling the grey base of the mansion; the field, wide as a park, dotted with its ancient timber; the wood, dun and sere, divided by a path visibly overgrown, greener with moss than the trees were with foliage; the church at the gates, the road, the tran-quil hills, all reposing in the autumn day’s sun; the horizon bounded by a propitious sky, azure, marbled with pearly white. No feature in the scene was extraordinary, but all was pleasing. When I turned from it and repassed the trap-door, I could scarcely see my way down the ladder; the attic seemed black as a vault compared with that arch of blue air to which I had been looking up, and to that sunlit scene of grove, pasture, and green hill, of which the hall was the cen-tre, and over which I had been gazing with delight.<p></p>  
<p></p> 162	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
Mrs. Fairfax stayed behind a moment to fasten the trap-door; I, by drift of groping, found the outlet from the attic, and proceeded to descend the narrow garret staircase. I lin-gered in the long passage to which this led, separating the front and back rooms of the third storey: narrow, low, and dim, with only one little window at the far end, and looking, with its two rows of small black doors all shut, like a corri-dor in some Bluebeard’s castle.<p></p> <p></p> While I paced softly on, the last sound I expected to hear in so still a region, a laugh, struck my ear. It was a curi-ous laugh; distinct, formal, mirthless. I stopped: the sound ceased, only for an instant; it began again, louder: for at first, though distinct, it was very low. It passed off in a clamorous peal that seemed to wake an echo in every lonely chamber; though it originated but in one, and I could have pointed out the door whence the accents issued.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Mrs. Fairfax!’ I called out: for I now heard her descend-ing the great stairs. ‘Did you hear that loud laugh? Who is it?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Some of the servants, very likely,’ she answered: ‘perhaps Grace Poole.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Did you hear it?’ I again inquired.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Yes, plainly: I often hear her: she sews in one of these rooms. Sometimes Leah is with her; they are frequently noisy together.’<p></p> <p></p> The laugh was repeated in its low, syllabic tone, and ter-minated in an odd murmur.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Grace!’ exclaimed Mrs. Fairfax.<p></p> <p></p> I really did not expect any Grace to answer; for the laugh<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	163<p></p>  
was as tragic, as preternatural a laugh as any I ever heard; and, but that it was high noon, and that no circumstance of ghostliness accompanied the curious cachinnation; but that neither scene nor season favoured fear, I should have been superstitiously afraid. However, the event showed me I was a fool for entertaining a sense even of surprise.<p></p> <p></p> The door nearest me opened, and a servant came out,—a woman of between thirty and forty; a set, square-made fig-ure, red-haired, and with a hard, plain face: any apparition less romantic or less ghostly could scarcely be conceived.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Too much noise, Grace,’ said Mrs. Fairfax. ‘Remember directions!’ Grace curtseyed silently and went in.<p></p> <p></p> ‘She is a person we have to sew and assist Leah in her housemaid’s work,’ continued the widow; ‘not altogether unobjectionable in some points, but she does well enough. By-the-bye, how have you got on with your new pupil this morning?’<p></p> <p></p> The conversation, thus turned on Adele, continued till we reached the light and cheerful region below. Adele came running to meet us in the hall, exclaiming—<p></p> <p></p> ‘Mesdames, vous etes servies!’ adding, ‘J’ai bien faim, moi!’<p></p> <p></p> We found dinner ready, and waiting for us in Mrs. Fair-fax’s room.<p></p>

Chapter XII<p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> The promise of a smooth career, which my first calm in-troduction to Thornfield Hall seemed to pledge, was not belied on a longer acquaintance with the place and its in-mates. Mrs. Fairfax turned out to be what she appeared, a placid-tempered, kind-natured woman, of competent edu-cation and average intelligence. My pupil was a lively child, who had been spoilt and indulged, and therefore was some-times wayward; but as she was committed entirely to my care, and no injudicious interference from any quarter ever thwarted my plans for her improvement, she soon forgot her little freaks, and became obedient and teachable. She had no great talents, no marked traits of character, no peculiar development of feeling or taste which raised her one inch above the ordinary level of childhood; but neither had she any deficiency or vice which sunk her below it. She made reasonable progress, entertained for me a vivacious, though perhaps not very profound, affection; and by her simplic-ity, gay prattle, and efforts to please, inspired me, in return, with a degree of attachment sufficient to make us both con-<p></p> <p></p> tent in each other’s society.<p></p> <p></p> This, par parenthese, will be thought cool language by persons who entertain solemn doctrines about the angelic nature of children, and the duty of those charged with their education to conceive for them an idolatrous devotion: but<p></p>

I am not writing to flatter parental egotism, to echo cant, or prop up humbug; I am merely telling the truth. I felt a con-scientious solicitude for Adele’s welfare and progress, and a quiet liking for her little self: just as I cherished towards Mrs. Fairfax a thankfulness for her kindness, and a plea-sure in her society proportionate to the tranquil regard she had for me, and the moderation of her mind and character.<p></p> <p></p> Anybody may blame me who likes, when I add fur-ther, that, now and then, when I took a walk by myself in the grounds; when I went down to the gates and looked through them along the road; or when, while Adele played with her nurse, and Mrs. Fairfax made jellies in the store-room, I climbed the three staircases, raised the trap-door of the attic, and having reached the leads, looked out afar over sequestered field and hill, and along dim sky-line—that then I longed for a power of vision which might overpass that limit; which might reach the busy world, towns, re-gions full of life I had heard of but never seen—that then I desired more of practical experience than I possessed; more of intercourse with my kind, of acquaintance with variety of character, than was here within my reach. I valued what was good in Mrs. Fairfax, and what was good in Adele; but I believed in the existence of other and more vivid kinds of goodness, and what I believed in I wished to behold.<p></p> <p></p> Who blames me? Many, no doubt; and I shall be called discontented. I could not help it: the restlessness was in my nature; it agitated me to pain sometimes. Then my sole relief was to walk along the corridor of the third storey, back-wards and forwards, safe in the silence and solitude of the<p></p>  
<p></p> 166	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
spot, and allow my mind’s eye to dwell on whatever bright visions rose before it—and, certainly, they were many and glowing; to let my heart be heaved by the exultant move-ment, which, while it swelled it in trouble, expanded it with life; and, best of all, to open my inward ear to a tale that was never ended—a tale my imagination created, and narrated continuously; quickened with all of incident, life, fire, feel-ing, that I desired and had not in my actual existence.<p></p> <p></p> It is in vain to say human beings ought to be satisfied with tranquillity: they must have action; and they will make it if they cannot find it. Millions are condemned to a stiller doom than mine, and millions are in silent revolt against their lot. Nobody knows how many rebellions be-sides political rebellions ferment in the masses of life which people earth. Women are supposed to be very calm gener-ally: but women feel just as men feel; they need exercise for their faculties, and a field for their efforts, as much as their brothers do; they suffer from too rigid a restraint, too ab-solute a stagnation, precisely as men would suffer; and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged fellow-creatures to say that they ought to confine themselves to making pud-dings and knitting stockings, to playing on the piano and embroidering bags. It is thoughtless to condemn them, or laugh at them, if they seek to do more or learn more than custom has pronounced necessary for their sex.<p></p> <p></p> When thus alone, I not unfrequently heard Grace Poole’s laugh: the same peal, the same low, slow ha! ha! which, when first heard, had thrilled me: I heard, too, her eccentric murmurs; stranger than her laugh. There were days when<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	167<p></p>  
she was quite silent; but there were others when I could not account for the sounds she made. Sometimes I saw her: she would come out of her room with a basin, or a plate, or a tray in her hand, go down to the kitchen and shortly re-turn, generally (oh, romantic reader, forgive me for telling the plain truth!) bearing a pot of porter. Her appearance always acted as a damper to the curiosity raised by her oral oddities: hard-featured and staid, she had no point to which interest could attach. I made some attempts to draw her into conversation, but she seemed a person of few words: a monosyllabic reply usually cut short every effort of that sort.<p></p> <p></p> The other members of the household, viz., John and his wife, Leah the housemaid, and Sophie the French nurse, were decent people; but in no respect remarkable; with Sophie I used to talk French, and sometimes I asked her questions about her native country; but she was not of a de-scriptive or narrative turn, and generally gave such vapid and confused answers as were calculated rather to check than encourage inquiry.<p></p> <p></p> October, November, December passed away. One after-noon in January, Mrs. Fairfax had begged a holiday for Adele, because she had a cold; and, as Adele seconded the request with an ardour that reminded me how precious occasional holidays had been to me in my own childhood, I accorded it, deeming that I did well in showing pliability on the point. It was a fine, calm day, though very cold; I was tired of sitting still in the library through a whole long morning: Mrs. Fair-fax had just written a letter which was waiting to be posted,<p></p>  
<p></p> 168	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
so I put on my bonnet and cloak and volunteered to carry it to Hay; the distance, two miles, would be a pleasant winter afternoon walk. Having seen Adele comfortably seated in her little chair by Mrs. Fairfax’s parlour fireside, and given her her best wax doll (which I usually kept enveloped in silver paper in a drawer) to play with, and a story-book for change of amusement; and having replied to her ‘Revenez bientot, ma bonne amie, ma chere Mdlle. Jeannette,’ with a kiss I set out.<p></p> <p></p> The ground was hard, the air was still, my road was lone-ly; I walked fast till I got warm, and then I walked slowly to enjoy and analyse the species of pleasure brooding for me in the hour and situation. It was three o’clock; the church bell tolled as I passed under the belfry: the charm of the hour lay in its approaching dimness, in the low-gliding and pale-beaming sun. I was a mile from Thornfield, in a lane noted for wild roses in summer, for nuts and blackberries in autumn, and even now possessing a few coral treasures in hips and haws, but whose best winter delight lay in its utter solitude and leafless repose. If a breath of air stirred, it made no sound here; for there was not a holly, not an evergreen to rustle, and the stripped hawthorn and hazel bushes were as still as the white, worn stones which causewayed the mid-dle of the path. Far and wide, on each side, there were only fields, where no cattle now browsed; and the little brown birds, which stirred occasionally in the hedge, looked like single russet leaves that had forgotten to drop.<p></p> <p></p> This lane inclined up -hill all the way to Hay; having reached the middle, I sat down on a stile which led thence<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	169<p></p>  
into a field. Gathering my mantle about me, and sheltering my hands in my muff, I did not feel the cold, though it froze keenly; as was attested by a sheet of ice covering the cause-way, where a little brooklet, now congealed, had overflowed after a rapid thaw some days since. From my seat I could look down on Thornfield: the grey and battlemented hall was the principal object in the vale below me; its woods and dark rookery rose against the west. I lingered till the sun went down amongst the trees, and sank crimson and clear behind them. I then turned eastward.<p></p> <p></p> On the hill-top above me sat the rising moon; pale yet as a cloud, but brightening momentarily, she looked over Hay, which, half lost in trees, sent up a blue smoke from its few chimneys: it was yet a mile distant, but in the absolute hush I could hear plainly its thin murmurs of life. My ear, too, felt the flow of currents; in what dales and depths I could not tell: but there were many hills beyond Hay, and doubt-less many becks threading their passes. That evening calm betrayed alike the tinkle of the nearest streams, the sough of the most remote.<p></p> <p></p> A rude noise broke on these fine ripplings and whisper-ings, at once so far away and so clear: a positive tramp, tramp, a metallic clatter, which effaced the soft wave -wanderings; as, in a picture, the solid mass of a crag, or the rough boles of a great oak, drawn in dark and strong on the foreground, efface the aerial distance of azure hill, sunny horizon, and blended clouds where tint melts into tint.<p></p> <p></p> The din was on the causeway: a horse was coming; the windings of the lane yet hid it, but it approached. I was just<p></p>  
<p></p> 170	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
leaving the stile; yet, as the path was narrow, I sat still to let it go by. In those days I was young, and all sorts of fancies bright and dark tenanted my mind: the memories of nurs-ery stories were there amongst other rubbish; and when they recurred, maturing youth added to them a vigour and vividness beyond what childhood could give. As this horse approached, and as I watched for it to appear through the dusk, I remembered certain of Bessie’s tales, wherein fig-ured a North-of-England spirit called a ‘Gytrash,’ which, in the form of horse, mule, or large dog, haunted solitary ways, and sometimes came upon belated travellers, as this horse was now coming upon me.<p></p> <p></p> It was very near, but not yet in sight; when, in addition to the tramp, tramp, I heard a rush under the hedge, and close down by the hazel stems glided a great dog, whose black and white colour made him a distinct object against the trees. It was exactly one form of Bessie’s Gytrash—a lion-like crea-ture with long hair and a huge head: it passed me, however, quietly enough; not staying to look up, with strange preter-canine eyes, in my face, as I half expected it would. The horse followed,—a tall steed, and on its back a rider. The man, the human being, broke the spell at once. Nothing ever rode the Gytrash: it was always alone; and goblins, to my notions, though they might tenant the dumb carcasses of beasts, could scarce covet shelter in the commonplace human form. No Gytrash was this,—only a traveller taking the short cut to Millcote. He passed, and I went on; a few steps, and I turned: a sliding sound and an exclamation of ‘What the deuce is to do now?’ and a clattering tumble, ar-<p></p>

rested my attention. Man and horse were down; they had slipped on the sheet of ice which glazed the causeway. The dog came bounding back, and seeing his master in a predic-ament, and hearing the horse groan, barked till the evening hills echoed the sound, which was deep in proportion to his magnitude. He snuffed round the prostrate group, and then he ran up to me; it was all he could do,—there was no other help at hand to summon. I obeyed him, and walked down to the traveller, by this time struggling himself free of his steed. His efforts were so vigorous, I thought he could not be much hurt; but I asked him the question—<p></p> <p></p> ‘Are you injured, sir?’<p></p> <p></p> I think he was swearing, but am not certain; however, he was pronouncing some formula which prevented him from replying to me directly.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Can I do anything?’ I asked again.<p></p> <p></p> ‘You must just stand on one side,’ he answered as he rose, first to his knees, and then to his feet. I did; whereupon be-gan a heaving, stamping, clattering process, accompanied by a barking and baying which removed me effectually some yards’ distance; but I would not be driven quite away till I saw the event. This was finally fortunate; the horse was re -established, and the dog was silenced with a ‘Down, Pilot!’ The traveller now, stooping, felt his foot and leg, as if trying whether they were sound; apparently something ailed them, for he halted to the stile whence I had just risen, and sat down.<p></p> <p></p> I was in the mood for being useful, or at least officious, I think, for I now drew near him again.<p></p>  
<p></p> 172	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
‘If you are hurt, and want help, sir, I can fetch some one either from Thornfield Hall or from Hay.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Thank you: I shall do: I have no broken bones,—only a sprain;’ and again he stood up and tried his foot, but the re-sult extorted an involuntary ‘Ugh!’<p></p> <p></p> Something of daylight still lingered, and the moon was waxing bright: I could see him plainly. His figure was en-veloped in a riding cloak, fur collared and steel clasped; its details were not apparent, but I traced the general points of middle height and considerable breadth of chest. He had a dark face, with stern features and a heavy brow; his eyes and gathered eyebrows looked ireful and thwarted just now; he was past youth, but had not reached middle-age; perhaps he might be thirty-five. I felt no fear of him, and but little shyness. Had he been a handsome, heroic-looking young gentleman, I should not have dared to stand thus question-ing him against his will, and offering my services unasked. I had hardly ever seen a handsome youth; never in my life spoken to one. I had a theoretical reverence and homage for beauty, elegance, gallantry, fascination; but had I met those qualities incarnate in masculine shape, I should have known instinctively that they neither had nor could have sympathy with anything in me, and should have shunned them as one would fire, lightning, or anything else that is bright but antipathetic.<p></p> <p></p> If even this stranger had smiled and been good-hu-moured to me when I addressed him; if he had put off my offer of assistance gaily and with thanks, I should have gone on my way and not felt any vocation to renew inqui-<p></p>

ries: but the frown, the roughness of the traveller, set me at<p></p> <p></p> my ease: I retained my station when he waved to me to go, and announced—<p></p> <p></p> ‘I cannot think of leaving you, sir, at so late an hour, in this solitary lane, till I see you are fit to mount your horse.’ He looked at me when I said this; he had hardly turned<p></p> <p></p> his eyes in my direction before.<p></p> <p></p> ‘I should think you ought to be at home yourself,’ said he, ‘if you have a home in this neighbourhood: where do you come from?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘From just below; and I am not at all afraid of being out late when it is moonlight: I will run over to Hay for you with pleasure, if you wish it: indeed, I am going there to post a letter.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘You live just below—do you mean at that house with the battlements?’ pointing to Thornfield Hall, on which the moon cast a hoary gleam, bringing it out distinct and pale from the woods that, by contrast with the western sky, now seemed one mass of shadow.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Yes, sir.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Whose house is it?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Mr. Rochester’s.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Do you know Mr. Rochester?’ ‘No, I have never seen him.’ ‘He is not resident, then?’ ‘No.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Can you tell me where he is?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘I cannot.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘You are not a servant at the hall, of course. You are—‘<p></p>

He stopped, ran his eye over my dress, which, as usual, was quite simple: a black merino cloak, a black beaver bon-net; neither of them half fine enough for a lady’s-maid. He seemed puzzled to decide what I was; I helped him.<p></p> <p></p> ‘I am the governess.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Ah, the governess!’ he repeated; ‘deuce take me, if I had not forgotten! The governess!’ and again my raiment under-went scrutiny. In two minutes he rose from the stile: his face expressed pain when he tried to move.<p></p> <p></p> ‘I cannot commission you to fetch help,’ he said; ‘but you may help me a little yourself, if you will be so kind.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Yes, sir.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘You have not an umbrella that I can use as a stick?’ ‘No.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Try to get hold of my horse’s bridle and lead him to me:<p></p> <p></p> you are not afraid?’<p></p> <p></p> I should have been afraid to touch a horse when alone, but when told to do it, I was disposed to obey. I put down my muff on the stile, and went up to the tall steed; I endea-voured to catch the bridle, but it was a spirited thing, and would not let me come near its head; I made effort on effort, though in vain: meantime, I was mortally afraid of its tram-pling fore -feet. The traveller waited and watched for some time, and at last he laughed.<p></p> <p></p> ‘I see,’ he said, ‘the mountain will never be brought to Mahomet, so all you can do is to aid Mahomet to go to the mountain; I must beg of you to come here.’<p></p> <p></p> I came. ‘Excuse me,’ he continued: ‘necessity compels me to make you useful.’ He laid a heavy hand on my shoulder,<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	175<p></p>  
and leaning on me with some stress, limped to his horse. Having once caught the bridle, he mastered it directly and sprang to his saddle; grimacing grimly as he made the ef-fort, for it wrenched his sprain.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Now,’ said he, releasing his under lip from a hard bite, ‘just hand me my whip; it lies there under the hedge.’<p></p> <p></p> I sought it and found it.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Thank you; now make haste with the letter to Hay, and return as fast as you can.’<p></p> <p></p> A touch of a spurred heel made his horse first start and rear, and then bound away; the dog rushed in his traces; all three vanished,<p></p> <p></p> ‘Like heath that, in the wilderness, The wild wind whirls away.’<p></p> <p></p> I took up my muff and walked on. The incident had occurred and was gone for me: it WAS an incident of no moment, no romance, no interest in a sense; yet it marked with change one single hour of a monotonous life. My help had been needed and claimed; I had given it: I was pleased to have done something; trivial, transitory though the deed was, it was yet an active thing, and I was weary of an exis-tence all passive. The new face, too, was like a new picture introduced to the gallery of memory; and it was dissimilar to all the others hanging there: firstly, because it was mas-culine; and, secondly, because it was dark, strong, and stern. I had it still before me when I entered Hay, and slipped the letter into the post- office; I saw it as I walked fast down-hill all the way home. When I came to the stile, I stopped a min-ute, looked round and listened, with an idea that a horse’s<p></p>  
<p></p> 176	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
hoofs might ring on the causeway again, and that a rider in a cloak, and a Gytrash-like Newfoundland dog, might be again apparent: I saw only the hedge and a pollard willow before me, rising up still and straight to meet the moon-beams; I heard only the faintest waft of wind roaming fitful among the trees round Thornfield, a mile distant; and when I glanced down in the direction of the murmur, my eye, tra-versing the hall-front, caught a light kindling in a window: it reminded me that I was late, and I hurried on.<p></p> <p></p> I did not like re-entering Thornfield. To pass its thresh-old was to return to stagnation; to cross the silent hall, to ascend the darksome staircase, to seek my own lonely little room, and then to meet tranquil Mrs. Fairfax, and spend the long winter evening with her, and her only, was to quell wholly the faint excitement wakened by my walk,—to slip again over my faculties the viewless fetters of an uniform and too still existence; of an existence whose very privileges of security and ease I was becoming incapable of appreciat-ing. What good it would have done me at that time to have been tossed in the storms of an uncertain struggling life, and to have been taught by rough and bitter experience to long for the calm amidst which I now repined! Yes, just as much good as it would do a man tired of sitting still in a ‘too easy chair’ to take a long walk: and just as natural was the wish to stir, under my circumstances, as it would be un-der his.<p></p> <p></p> I lingered at the gates; I lingered on the lawn; I paced backwards and forwards on the pavement; the shutters of the glass door were closed; I could not see into the interior;<p></p>

and both my eyes and spirit seemed drawn from the gloomy house—from the grey-hollow filled with rayless cells, as it appeared to me—to that sky expanded before me,—a blue sea absolved from taint of cloud; the moon ascending it in solemn march; her orb seeming to look up as she left the hill-tops, from behind which she had come, far and farther below her, and aspired to the zenith, midnight dark in its fathomless depth and measureless distance; and for those trembling stars that followed her course; they made my heart tremble, my veins glow when I viewed them. Little things recall us to earth; the clock struck in the hall; that sufficed; I turned from moon and stars, opened a side-door, and went in.<p></p> <p></p> The hall was not dark, nor yet was it lit, only by the high-hung bronze lamp; a warm glow suffused both it and the lower steps of the oak staircase. This ruddy shine issued from the great dining-room, whose two-leaved door stood open, and showed a genial fire in the grate, glancing on marble hearth and brass fire-irons, and revealing purple draperies and polished furniture, in the most pleasant ra-diance. It revealed, too, a group near the mantelpiece: I had scarcely caught it, and scarcely become aware of a cheerful mingling of voices, amongst which I seemed to distinguish the tones of Adele, when the door closed.<p></p> <p></p> I hastened to Mrs. Fairfax’s room; there was a fire there too, but no candle, and no Mrs. Fairfax. Instead, all alone, sitting upright on the rug, and gazing with gravity at the blaze, I beheld a great black and white long-haired dog, just like the Gytrash of the lane. It was so like it that I went for-<p></p>  
<p></p> 178	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
ward and said—‘Pilot’ and the thing got up and came to me and snuffed me. I caressed him, and he wagged his great tail; but he looked an eerie creature to be alone with, and I could not tell whence he had come. I rang the bell, for I wanted a candle; and I wanted, too, to get an account of this visitant. Leah entered.<p></p> <p></p> ‘What dog is this?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘He came with master.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘With whom?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘With master—Mr. Rochester—he is just arrived.’ ‘Indeed! and is Mrs. Fairfax with him?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Yes, and Miss Adele; they are in the dining-room, and John is gone for a surgeon; for master has had an accident; his horse fell and his ankle is sprained.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Did the horse fall in Hay Lane?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Yes, coming down-hill; it slipped on some ice.’ ‘Ah! Bring me a candle will you Leah?’<p></p> <p></p> Leah brought it; she entered, followed by Mrs. Fairfax, who repeated the news; adding that Mr. Carter the surgeon was come, and was now with Mr. Rochester: then she hur-ried out to give orders about tea, and I went upstairs to take off my things.<p></p>

Chapter XIII<p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> Mr. Rochester, it seems, by the surgeon’s orders, went to bed early that night; nor did he rise soon next morn-ing. When he did come down, it was to attend to business:<p></p> <p></p> his agent and some of his tenants were arrived, and waiting to speak with him.<p></p> <p></p> Adele and I had now to vacate the library: it would be in daily requisition as a reception-room for callers. A fire was lit in an apartment upstairs, and there I carried our books, and arranged it for the future schoolroom. I discerned in the course of the morning that Thornfield Hall was a changed place: no longer silent as a church, it echoed every hour or two to a knock at the door, or a clang of the bell; steps, too, often traversed the hall, and new voices spoke in different keys below; a rill from the outer world was flowing through it; it had a master: for my part, I liked it better.<p></p> <p></p> Adele was not easy to teach that day; she could not apply: she kept running to the door and looking over the banis-ters to see if she could get a glimpse of Mr. Rochester; then she coined pretexts to go downstairs, in order, as I shrewd-ly suspected, to visit the library, where I knew she was not wanted; then, when I got a little angry, and made her sit still, she continued to talk incessantly of her ‘ami, Monsieur Edouard Fairfax DE Rochester,’ as she dubbed him (I had not before heard his prenomens), and to conjecture what<p></p>  
<p></p> 180	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
presents he had brought her: for it appears he had intimated the night before, that when his luggage came from Millcote, there would be found amongst it a little box in whose con-tents she had an interest.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Et cela doit signifier,’ said she, ‘qu’il y aura le dedans un cadeau pour moi, et peut-etre pour vous aussi, mademoi-selle. Monsieur a parle de vous: il m’a demande le nom de ma gouvernante, et si elle n’etait pas une petite personne, assez mince et un peu pale. J’ai dit qu’oui: car c’est vrai, n’est-ce pas, mademoiselle?’<p></p> <p></p> I and my pupil dined as usual in Mrs. Fairfax’s parlour; the afternoon was wild and snowy, and we passed it in the schoolroom. At dark I allowed Adele to put away books and work, and to run downstairs; for, from the compara-tive silence below, and from the cessation of appeals to the door-bell, I conjectured that Mr. Rochester was now at lib-erty. Left alone, I walked to the window; but nothing was to be seen thence: twilight and snowflakes together thickened the air, and hid the very shrubs on the lawn. I let down the curtain and went back to the fireside.<p></p> <p></p> In the clear embers I was tracing a view, not unlike a pic-ture I remembered to have seen of the castle of Heidelberg, on the Rhine, when Mrs. Fairfax came in, breaking up by her entrance the fiery mosaic I had been piercing together, and scattering too some heavy unwelcome thoughts that were beginning to throng on my solitude.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Mr. Rochester would be glad if you and your pupil would take tea with him in the drawing-room this evening,’ said she: ‘he has been so much engaged all day that he could not<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	181<p></p>  
ask to see you before.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘When is his tea-time?’ I inquired.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Oh, at six o’clock: he keeps early hours in the country. You had better change your frock now; I will go with you and fasten it. Here is a candle.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Is it necessary to change my frock?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Yes, you had better: I always dress for the evening when Mr. Rochester is here.’<p></p> <p></p> This additional ceremony seemed somewhat stately; however, I repaired to my room, and, with Mrs. Fairfax’s aid, replaced my black stuff dress by one of black silk; the best and the only additional one I had, except one of light grey, which, in my Lowood notions of the toilette, I thought too fine to be worn, except on first-rate occasions.<p></p> <p></p> ‘You want a brooch,’ said Mrs. Fairfax. I had a single little pearl ornament which Miss Temple gave me as a parting keepsake: I put it on, and then we went downstairs. Unused as I was to strangers, it was rather a trial to appear thus formally summoned in Mr. Rochester’s presence. I let Mrs. Fairfax precede me into the dining-room, and kept in her shade as we crossed that apartment; and, passing the arch, whose curtain was now dropped, entered the elegant recess beyond.<p></p> <p></p> Two wax candles stood lighted on the table, and two on the mantelpiece; basking in the light and heat of a su-perb fire, lay Pilot—Adele knelt near him. Half reclined on a couch appeared Mr. Rochester, his foot supported by the cushion; he was looking at Adele and the dog: the fire shone full on his face. I knew my traveller with his broad and jetty<p></p>  
<p></p> 182	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
eyebrows; his square forehead, made squarer by the hori-zontal sweep of his black hair. I recognised his decisive nose, more remarkable for character than beauty; his full nostrils, denoting, I thought, choler; his grim mouth, chin, and jaw— yes, all three were very grim, and no mistake. His shape, now divested of cloak, I perceived harmonised in square-ness with his physiognomy: I suppose it was a good figure in the athletic sense of the term—broad chested and thin flanked, though neither tall nor graceful.<p></p> <p></p> Mr. Rochester must have been aware of the entrance of Mrs. Fairfax and myself; but it appeared he was not in the mood to notice us, for he never lifted his head as we ap-proached.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Here is Miss Eyre, sir,’ said Mrs. Fairfax, in her quiet way. He bowed, still not taking his eyes from the group of the dog and child.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Let Miss Eyre be seated,’ said he: and there was some-thing in the forced stiff bow, in the impatient yet formal tone, which seemed further to express, ‘What the deuce is it to me whether Miss Eyre be there or not? At this moment I am not disposed to accost her.’<p></p> <p></p> I sat down quite disembarrassed. A reception of finished politeness would probably have confused me: I could not have returned or repaid it by answering grace and elegance on my part; but harsh caprice laid me under no obligation; on the contrary, a decent quiescence, under the freak of manner, gave me the advantage. Besides, the eccentricity of the proceeding was piquant: I felt interested to see how he would go on.<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	183<p></p>  
He went on as a statue would, that is, he neither spoke nor moved. Mrs. Fairfax seemed to think it necessary that some one should be amiable, and she began to talk. Kindly, as usual—and, as usual, rather trite—she condoled with him on the pressure of business he had had all day; on the an-noyance it must have been to him with that painful sprain: then she commended his patience and perseverance in go-ing through with it.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Madam, I should like some tea,’ was the sole rejoinder she got. She hastened to ring the bell; and when the tray came, she proceeded to arrange the cups, spoons, &c., with assiduous celerity. I and Adele went to the table; but the master did not leave his couch.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Will you hand Mr. Rochester’s cup?’ said Mrs. Fairfax to me; ‘Adele might perhaps spill it.’<p></p> <p></p> I did as requested. As he took the cup from my hand, Adele, thinking the moment propitious for making a request in my favour, cried out—<p></p> <p></p> ‘N’est-ce pas, monsieur, qu’il y a un cadeau pour Made-moiselle Eyre dans votre petit coffre?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Who talks of cadeaux?’ said he gruffly. ‘Did you expect a present, Miss Eyre? Are you fond of presents?’ and he searched my face with eyes that I saw were dark, irate, and piercing.<p></p> <p></p> ‘I hardly know, sir; I have little experience of them: they are generally thought pleasant things.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Generally thought? But what do YOU think?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘I should be obliged to take time, sir, before I could give you an answer worthy of your acceptance: a present has<p></p>  
<p></p> 184	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
many faces to it, has it not? and one should consider all, be-fore pronouncing an opinion as to its nature.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Miss Eyre, you are not so unsophisticated as Adele: she demands a ‘cadeau,’ clamorously, the moment she sees me: you beat about the bush.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Because I have less confidence in my deserts than Adele has: she can prefer the claim of old acquaintance, and the right too of custom; for she says you have always been in the habit of giving her playthings; but if I had to make out a case I should be puzzled, since I am a stranger, and have done nothing to entitle me to an acknowledgment.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Oh, don’t fall back on over-modesty! I have examined Adele, and find you have taken great pains with her: she is not bright, she has no talents; yet in a short time she has made much improvement.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Sir, you have now given me my ‘cadeau;’ I am obliged to you: it is the meed teachers most covet—praise of their pu-pils’ progress.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Humph!’ said Mr. Rochester, and he took his tea in si-lence.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Come to the fire,’ said the master, when the tray was tak-en away, and Mrs. Fairfax had settled into a corner with her knitting; while Adele was leading me by the hand round the room, showing me the beautiful books and ornaments on the consoles and chiffonnieres. We obeyed, as in duty bound; Adele wanted to take a seat on my knee, but she was ordered to amuse herself with Pilot.<p></p> <p></p> ‘You have been resident in my house three months?’ ‘Yes, sir.’<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	185<p></p>  
‘And you came from—?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘From Lowood school, in—shire.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Ah! a charitable concern. How long were you there?’ ‘Eight years.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Eight years! you must be tenacious of life. I thought half the time in such a place would have done up any constitu-tion! No wonder you have rather the look of another world. I marvelled where you had got that sort of face. When you came on me in Hay Lane last night, I thought unaccount-ably of fairy tales, and had half a mind to demand whether you had bewitched my horse: I am not sure yet. Who are your parents?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘I have none.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Nor ever had, I suppose: do you remember them?’ ‘No.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘I thought not. And so you were waiting for your people when you sat on that stile?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘For whom, sir?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘For the men in green: it was a proper moonlight evening for them. Did I break through one of your rings, that you spread that damned ice on the causeway?’<p></p> <p></p> I shook my head. ‘The men in green all forsook England a hundred years ago,’ said I, speaking as seriously as he had done. ‘And not even in Hay Lane, or the fields about it, could you find a trace of them. I don’t think either summer or har-vest, or winter moon, will ever shine on their revels more.’<p></p> <p></p> Mrs. Fairfax had dropped her knitting, and, with raised eyebrows, seemed wondering what sort of talk this was.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Well,’ resumed Mr. Rochester, ‘if you disown parents,<p></p>  
<p></p> 186	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
you must have some sort of kinsfolk: uncles and aunts?’ ‘No; none that I ever saw.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘And your home?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘I have none.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Where do your brothers and sisters live?’ ‘I have no brothers or sisters.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Who recommended you to come here?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘I advertised, and Mrs. Fairfax answered my advertise-ment.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Yes,’ said the good lady, who now knew what ground we were upon, ‘and I am daily thankful for the choice Provi-dence led me to make. Miss Eyre has been an invaluable companion to me, and a kind and careful teacher to Adele.’ ‘Don’t trouble yourself to give her a character,’ returned Mr. Rochester: ‘eulogiums will not bias me; I shall judge for<p></p> <p></p> myself. She began by felling my horse.’ ‘Sir?’ said Mrs. Fairfax.<p></p> <p></p> ‘I have to thank her for this sprain.’ The widow looked bewildered.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Miss Eyre, have you ever lived in a town?’ ‘No, sir.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Have you seen much society?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘None but the pupils and teachers of Lowood, and now the inmates of Thornfield.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Have you read much?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Only such books as came in my way; and they have not been numerous or very learned.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘You have lived the life of a nun: no doubt you are well drilled in religious forms;—Brocklehurst, who I under-<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	187<p></p>  
stand directs Lowood, is a parson, is he not?’ ‘Yes, sir.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘And you girls probably worshipped him, as a convent full of religieuses would worship their director.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Oh, no.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘You are very cool! No! What! a novice not worship her priest! That sounds blasphemous.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘I disliked Mr. Brocklehurst; and I was not alone in the feeling. He is a harsh man; at once pompous and meddling; he cut off our hair; and for economy’s sake bought us bad needles and thread, with which we could hardly sew.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘That was very false economy,’ remarked Mrs. Fairfax, who now again caught the drift of the dialogue.<p></p> <p></p> ‘And was that the head and front of his offending?’ de-manded Mr. Rochester.<p></p> <p></p> ‘He starved us when he had the sole superintendence of the provision department, before the committee was ap-pointed; and he bored us with long lectures once a week, and with evening readings from books of his own inditing, about sudden deaths and judgments, which made us afraid to go to bed.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘What age were you when you went to Lowood?’ ‘About ten.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘And you stayed there eight years: you are now, then, eighteen?’<p></p> <p></p> I assented.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Arithmetic, you see, is useful; without its aid, I should hardly have been able to guess your age. It is a point diffi-cult to fix where the features and countenance are so much<p></p>  
<p></p> 188	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
at variance as in your case. And now what did you learn at Lowood? Can you play?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘A little.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Of course: that is the established answer. Go into the library—I mean, if you please.—(Excuse my tone of com-mand; I am used to say, ‘Do this,’ and it is done: I cannot alter my customary habits for one new inmate.)—Go, then, into the library; take a candle with you; leave the door open; sit down to the piano, and play a tune.’<p></p> <p></p> I departed, obeying his directions.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Enough!’ he called out in a few minutes. ‘You play A LITTLE, I see; like any other English school-girl; perhaps rather better than some, but not well.’<p></p> <p></p> I closed the piano and returned. Mr. Rochester contin-ued—‘Adele showed me some sketches this morning, which she said were yours. I don’t know whether they were entire-ly of your doing; probably a master aided you?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘No, indeed!’ I interjected.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Ah! that pricks pride. Well, fetch me your portfolio, if you can vouch for its contents being original; but don’t pass your word unless you are certain: I can recognise patch-work.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Then I will say nothing, and you shall judge for your-self, sir.’<p></p> <p></p> I brought the portfolio from the library.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Approach the table,’ said he; and I wheeled it to his couch.<p></p> <p></p> Adele and Mrs. Fairfax drew near to see the pictures.<p></p> <p></p> ‘No crowding,’ said Mr. Rochester: ‘take the drawings from my hand as I finish with them; but don’t push your<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	189<p></p>  
faces up to mine.’<p></p> <p></p> He deliberately scrutinised each sketch and painting. Three he laid aside; the others, when he had examined them, he swept from him.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Take them off to the other table, Mrs. Fairfax,’ said he, and look at them with Adele;—you’ (glancing at me) ‘re-sume your seat, and answer my questions. I perceive those pictures were done by one hand: was that hand yours?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Yes.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘And when did you find time to do them? They have taken much time, and some thought.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘I did them in the last two vacations I spent at Lowood, when I had no other occupation.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Where did you get your copies?’ ‘Out of my head.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘That head I see now on your shoulders?’ ‘Yes, sir.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Has it other furniture of the same kind within?’ ‘I should think it may have: I should hope—better.’<p></p> <p></p> He spread the pictures before him, and again surveyed them alternately.<p></p> <p></p> While he is so occupied, I will tell you, reader, what they are: and first, I must premise that they are nothing won-derful. The subjects had, indeed, risen vividly on my mind. As I saw them with the spiritual eye, before I attempted to embody them, they were striking; but my hand would not second my fancy, and in each case it had wrought out but a pale portrait of the thing I had conceived.<p></p> <p></p> These pictures were in water-colours. The first represent-<p></p>  
<p></p> 190	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
ed clouds low and livid, rolling over a swollen sea: all the distance was in eclipse; so, too, was the foreground; or rath-er, the nearest billows, for there was no land. One gleam of light lifted into relief a half-submerged mast, on which sat a cormorant, dark and large, with wings flecked with foam; its beak held a gold bracelet set with gems, that I had touched with as brilliant tints as my palette could yield, and as glittering distinctness as my pencil could impart. Sink-ing below the bird and mast, a drowned corpse glanced through the green water; a fair arm was the only limb clear-ly visible, whence the bracelet had been washed or torn.<p></p> <p></p> The second picture contained for foreground only the dim peak of a hill, with grass and some leaves slanting as if by a breeze. Beyond and above spread an expanse of sky, dark blue as at twilight: rising into the sky was a woman’s shape to the bust, portrayed in tints as dusk and soft as I could combine. The dim forehead was crowned with a star; the lineaments below were seen as through the suffusion of vapour; the eyes shone dark and wild; the hair streamed shadowy, like a beamless cloud torn by storm or by elec-tric travail. On the neck lay a pale reflection like moonlight; the same faint lustre touched the train of thin clouds from which rose and bowed this vision of the Evening Star.<p></p> <p></p> The third showed the pinnacle of an iceberg piercing a polar winter sky: a muster of northern lights reared their dim lances, close serried, along the horizon. Throwing these into distance, rose, in the foreground, a head,—a colossal head, inclined towards the iceberg, and resting against it. Two thin hands, joined under the forehead, and support-<p></p>

ing it, drew up before the lower features a sable veil, a brow quite bloodless, white as bone, and an eye hollow and fixed, blank of meaning but for the glassiness of despair, alone were visible. Above the temples, amidst wreathed turban folds of black drapery, vague in its character and consis-tency as cloud, gleamed a ring of white flame, gemmed with sparkles of a more lurid tinge. This pale crescent was ‘the likeness of a kingly crown;’ what it diademed was ‘the shape which shape had none.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Were you happy when you painted these pictures?’ asked Mr. Rochester presently.<p></p> <p></p> ‘I was absorbed, sir: yes, and I was happy. To paint them, in short, was to enjoy one of the keenest pleasures I have ever known.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘That is not saying much. Your pleasures, by your own ac-count, have been few; but I daresay you did exist in a kind of artist’s dreamland while you blent and arranged these strange tints. Did you sit at them long each day?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘I had nothing else to do, because it was the vacation, and I sat at them from morning till noon, and from noon till night: the length of the midsummer days favoured my in-clination to apply.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘And you felt self-satisfied with the result of your ardent labours?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Far from it. I was tormented by the contrast between my idea and my handiwork: in each case I had imagined some-thing which I was quite powerless to realise.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Not quite: you have secured the shadow of your thought; but no more, probably. You had not enough of the artist’s<p></p>  
<p></p> 192	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
skill and science to give it full being: yet the drawings are, for a school- girl, peculiar. As to the thoughts, they are elf-ish. These eyes in the Evening Star you must have seen in a dream. How could you make them look so clear, and yet not at all brilliant? for the planet above quells their rays. And what meaning is that in their solemn depth? And who taught you to paint wind. There is a high gale in that sky, and on this hill-top. Where did you see Latmos? For that is Latmos. There! put the drawings away!’<p></p> <p></p> I had scarce tied the strings of the portfolio, when, looking at his watch, he said abruptly—<p></p> <p></p> ‘It is nine o’clock: what are you about, Miss Eyre, to let Adele sit up so long? Take her to bed.’<p></p> <p></p> Adele went to kiss him before quitting the room: he en-dured the caress, but scarcely seemed to relish it more than Pilot would have done, nor so much.<p></p> <p></p> ‘I wish you all good-night, now,’ said he, making a move-ment of the hand towards the door, in token that he was tired of our company, and wished to dismiss us. Mrs. Fair-fax folded up her knitting: I took my portfolio: we curtseyed to him, received a frigid bow in return, and so withdrew.<p></p> <p></p> ‘You said Mr. Rochester was not strikingly peculiar, Mrs. Fairfax,’ I observed, when I rejoined her in her room, after putting Adele to bed.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Well, is he?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘I think so: he is very changeful and abrupt.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘True: no doubt he may appear so to a stranger, but I am so accustomed to his manner, I never think of it; and then, if he has peculiarities of temper, allowance should be made.’<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	193<p></p>  
‘Why?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Partly because it is his nature—and we can none of us help our nature; and partly because he has painful thoughts, no doubt, to harass him, and make his spirits unequal.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘What about?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Family troubles, for one thing.’ ‘But he has no family.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Not now, but he has had—or, at least, relatives. He lost his elder brother a few years since.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘His ELDER brother?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Yes. The present Mr. Rochester has not been very long in possession of the property; only about nine years.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Nine years is a tolerable time. Was he so very fond of his brother as to be still inconsolable for his loss?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Why, no—perhaps not. I believe there were some mis-understandings between them. Mr. Rowland Rochester was not quite just to Mr. Edward; and perhaps he prejudiced his father against him. The old gentleman was fond of mon-ey, and anxious to keep the family estate together. He did not like to diminish the property by division, and yet he was anxious that Mr. Edward should have wealth, too, to keep up the consequence of the name; and, soon after he was of age, some steps were taken that were not quite fair, and made a great deal of mischief. Old Mr. Rochester and Mr. Rowland combined to bring Mr. Edward into what he considered a painful position, for the sake of making his fortune: what the precise nature of that position was I never clearly knew, but his spirit could not brook what he had to suffer in it. He is not very forgiving: he broke with his fam-<p></p>  
<p></p> 194	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
ily, and now for many years he has led an unsettled kind of life. I don’t think he has ever been resident at Thornfield for a fortnight together, since the death of his brother without a will left him master of the estate; and, indeed, no wonder he shuns the old place.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Why should he shun it?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Perhaps he thinks it gloomy.’<p></p> <p></p> The answer was evasive. I should have liked something clearer; but Mrs. Fairfax either could not, or would not, give me more explicit information of the origin and nature of Mr. Rochester’s trials. She averred they were a mystery to herself, and that what she knew was chiefly from conjecture. It was evident, indeed, that she wished me to drop the sub-ject, which I did accordingly.<p></p>

Chapter XIV<p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> For several subsequent days I saw little of Mr. Rochester. In the mornings he seemed much engaged with busi-ness, and, in the afternoon, gentlemen from Millcote or the neighbourhood called, and sometimes stayed to dine with him. When his sprain was well enough to admit of horse exercise, he rode out a good deal; probably to return these<p></p> <p></p> visits, as he generally did not come back till late at night. During this interval, even Adele was seldom sent for to<p></p> <p></p> his presence, and all my acquaintance with him was con-fined to an occasional rencontre in the hall, on the stairs, or in the gallery, when he would sometimes pass me haugh-tily and coldly, just acknowledging my presence by a distant nod or a cool glance, and sometimes bow and smile with gentlemanlike affability. His changes of mood did not of-fend me, because I saw that I had nothing to do with their alternation; the ebb and flow depended on causes quite dis-connected with me.<p></p> <p></p> One day he had had company to dinner, and had sent for my portfolio; in order, doubtless, to exhibit its contents: the gentlemen went away early, to attend a public meeting at Millcote, as Mrs. Fairfax informed me; but the night being wet and inclement, Mr. Rochester did not accompany them. Soon after they were gone he rang the bell: a message came that I and Adele were to go downstairs. I brushed Adele’s<p></p>  
<p></p> 196	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
hair and made her neat, and having ascertained that I was myself in my usual Quaker trim, where there was nothing to retouch— all being too close and plain, braided locks in-cluded, to admit of disarrangement—we descended, Adele wondering whether the petit coffre was at length come; for, owing to some mistake, its arrival had hitherto been de-layed. She was gratified: there it stood, a little carton, on the table when we entered the dining-room. She appeared to know it by instinct.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Ma boite! ma boite!’ exclaimed she, running towards it. ‘Yes, there is your ‘boite’ at last: take it into a corner, you genuine daughter of Paris, and amuse yourself with dis-embowelling it,’ said the deep and rather sarcastic voice of Mr. Rochester, proceeding from the depths of an immense easy-chair at the fireside. ‘And mind,’ he continued, ‘don’t bother me with any details of the anatomical process, or any notice of the condition of the entrails: let your oper-ation be conducted in silence: tiens-toi tranquille, enfant;<p></p> <p></p> comprends-tu?’<p></p> <p></p> Adele seemed scarcely to need the warning—she had already retired to a sofa with her treasure, and was busy un-tying the cord which secured the lid. Having removed this impediment, and lifted certain silvery envelopes of tissue paper, she merely exclaimed—<p></p> <p></p> ‘Oh ciel! Que c’est beau!’ and then remained absorbed in ecstatic contemplation.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Is Miss Eyre there?’ now demanded the master, half ris-ing from his seat to look round to the door, near which I still stood.<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	197<p></p>  
‘Ah! well, come forward; be seated here.’ He drew a chair near his own. ‘I am not fond of the prattle of children,’ he continued; ‘for, old bachelor as I am, I have no pleasant associations connected with their lisp. It would be intoler-able to me to pass a whole evening tete-e-tete with a brat. Don’t draw that chair farther off, Miss Eyre; sit down exact-ly where I placed it—if you please, that is. Confound these civilities! I continually forget them. Nor do I particularly affect simple-minded old ladies. By- the-bye, I must have mine in mind; it won’t do to neglect her; she is a Fairfax, or wed to one; and blood is said to be thicker than water.’<p></p> <p></p> He rang, and despatched an invitation to Mrs. Fairfax, who soon arrived, knitting-basket in hand.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Good evening, madam; I sent to you for a charitable purpose. I have forbidden Adele to talk to me about her presents, and she is bursting with repletion: have the good-ness to serve her as auditress and interlocutrice; it will be one of the most benevolent acts you ever performed.’<p></p> <p></p> Adele, indeed, no sooner saw Mrs. Fairfax, than she sum-moned her to her sofa, and there quickly filled her lap with the porcelain, the ivory, the waxen contents of her ‘boite;’ pouring out, meantime, explanations and raptures in such broken English as she was mistress of.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Now I have performed the part of a good host,’ pursued Mr. Rochester, ‘put my guests into the way of amusing each other, I ought to be at liberty to attend to my own pleasure. Miss Eyre, draw your chair still a little farther forward: you are yet too far back; I cannot see you without disturbing my position in this comfortable chair, which I have no mind<p></p>  
<p></p> 198	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
to do.’<p></p> <p></p> I did as I was bid, though I would much rather have re-mained somewhat in the shade; but Mr. Rochester had such a direct way of giving orders, it seemed a matter of course to obey him promptly.<p></p> <p></p> We were, as I have said, in the dining-room: the lustre, which had been lit for dinner, filled the room with a festal breadth of light; the large fire was all red and clear; the pur-ple curtains hung rich and ample before the lofty window and loftier arch; everything was still, save the subdued chat of Adele (she dared not speak loud), and, filling up each pause, the beating of winter rain against the panes.<p></p> <p></p> Mr. Rochester, as he sat in his damask-covered chair, looked different to what I had seen him look before; not quite so stern— much less gloomy. There was a smile on his lips, and his eyes sparkled, whether with wine or not, I am not sure; but I think it very probable. He was, in short, in his after-dinner mood; more expanded and genial, and also more self-indulgent than the frigid and rigid temper of the morning; still he looked preciously grim, cushioning his massive head against the swelling back of his chair, and receiving the light of the fire on his granite-hewn features, and in his great, dark eyes; for he had great, dark eyes, and very fine eyes, too—not without a certain change in their depths sometimes, which, if it was not softness, reminded you, at least, of that feeling.<p></p> <p></p> He had been looking two minutes at the fire, and I had been looking the same length of time at him, when, turning suddenly, he caught my gaze fastened on his physiognomy.<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	199<p></p>  
‘You examine me, Miss Eyre,’ said he: ‘do you think me handsome?’<p></p> <p></p> I should, if I had deliberated, have replied to this ques-tion by something conventionally vague and polite; but the answer somehow slipped from my tongue before I was aware—‘No, sir.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Ah! By my word! there is something singular about you,’ said he: ‘you have the air of a little nonnette; quaint, quiet, grave, and simple, as you sit with your hands before you, and your eyes generally bent on the carpet (except, by-the-bye, when they are directed piercingly to my face; as just now, for instance); and when one asks you a question, or makes a remark to which you are obliged to reply, you rap out a round rejoinder, which, if not blunt, is at least brusque. What do you mean by it?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Sir, I was too plain; I beg your pardon. I ought to have replied that it was not easy to give an impromptu answer to a question about appearances; that tastes mostly differ; and that beauty is of little consequence, or something of that sort.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘You ought to have replied no such thing. Beauty of little consequence, indeed! And so, under pretence of softening the previous outrage, of stroking and soothing me into pla-cidity, you stick a sly penknife under my ear! Go on: what fault do you find with me, pray? I suppose I have all my limbs and all my features like any other man?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Mr. Rochester, allow me to disown my first answer: I in-<p></p> <p></p> tended no pointed repartee: it was only a blunder.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Just so: I think so: and you shall be answerable for it.<p></p>  
<p></p> 200	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
Criticise me: does my forehead not please you?’<p></p> <p></p> He lifted up the sable waves of hair which lay horizontally over his brow, and showed a solid enough mass of intellec-tual organs, but an abrupt deficiency where the suave sign of benevolence should have risen.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Now, ma’am, am I a fool?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Far from it, sir. You would, perhaps, think me rude if I inquired in return whether you are a philanthropist?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘There again! Another stick of the penknife, when she pretended to pat my head: and that is because I said I did not like the society of children and old women (low be it spoken!). No, young lady, I am not a general philanthropist; but I bear a conscience;’ and he pointed to the prominences which are said to indicate that faculty, and which, fortunate-ly for him, were sufficiently conspicuous; giving, indeed, a marked breadth to the upper part of his head: ‘and, besides, I once had a kind of rude tenderness of heart. When I was as old as you, I was a feeling fellow enough, partial to the un-fledged, unfostered, and unlucky; but Fortune has knocked me about since: she has even kneaded me with her knuckles, and now I flatter myself I am hard and tough as an India-rubber ball; pervious, though, through a chink or two still, and with one sentient point in the middle of the lump. Yes: does that leave hope for me?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Hope of what, sir?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Of my final re-transformation from India-rubber back to flesh?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Decidedly he has had too much wine,’ I thought; and I did not know what answer to make to his queer question:<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	201<p></p>  
how could I tell whether he was capable of being re-trans-formed?<p></p> <p></p> ‘You looked very much puzzled, Miss Eyre; and though you are not pretty any more than I am handsome, yet a puz-zled air becomes you; besides, it is convenient, for it keeps those searching eyes of yours away from my physiognomy, and busies them with the worsted flowers of the rug; so puzzle on. Young lady, I am disposed to be gregarious and communicative to-night.’<p></p> <p></p> With this announcement he rose from his chair, and stood, leaning his arm on the marble mantelpiece: in that attitude his shape was seen plainly as well as his face; his unusual breadth of chest, disproportionate almost to his length of limb. I am sure most people would have thought him an ugly man; yet there was so much unconscious pride in his port; so much ease in his demeanour; such a look of complete indifference to his own external appearance; so haughty a reliance on the power of other qualities, intrinsic or adventitious, to atone for the lack of mere personal at-tractiveness, that, in looking at him, one inevitably shared the indifference, and, even in a blind, imperfect sense, put faith in the confidence.<p></p> <p></p> ‘I am disposed to be gregarious and communicative to-night,’ he repeated, ‘and that is why I sent for you: the fire and the chandelier were not sufficient company for me; nor would Pilot have been, for none of these can talk. Adele is a degree better, but still far below the mark; Mrs. Fairfax dit-to; you, I am persuaded, can suit me if you will: you puzzled me the first evening I invited you down here. I have almost<p></p>  
<p></p> 202	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
forgotten you since: other ideas have driven yours from my head; but to-night I am resolved to be at ease; to dismiss what importunes, and recall what pleases. It would please me now to draw you out—to learn more of you—therefore speak.’<p></p> <p></p> Instead of speaking, I smiled; and not a very complacent or submissive smile either.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Speak,’ he urged.<p></p> <p></p> ‘What about, sir?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Whatever you like. I leave both the choice of subject and the manner of treating it entirely to yourself.’<p></p> <p></p> Accordingly I sat and said nothing: ‘If he expects me to talk for the mere sake of talking and showing off, he will find he has addressed himself to the wrong person,’ I thought.<p></p> <p></p> ‘You are dumb, Miss Eyre.’<p></p> <p></p> I was dumb still. He bent his head a little towards me, and with a single hasty glance seemed to dive into my eyes.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Stubborn?’ he said, ‘and annoyed. Ah! it is consistent. I put my request in an absurd, almost insolent form. Miss Eyre, I beg your pardon. The fact is, once for all, I don’t wish to treat you like an inferior: that is’ (correcting himself), ‘I claim only such superiority as must result from twenty years’ difference in age and a century’s advance in experi-ence. This is legitimate, et j’y tiens, as Adele would say; and it is by virtue of this superiority, and this alone, that I de-sire you to have the goodness to talk to me a little now, and divert my thoughts, which are galled with dwelling on one point—cankering as a rusty nail.’<p></p> <p></p> He had deigned an explanation, almost an apology, and<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	203<p></p>  
I did not feel insensible to his condescension, and would not seem so.<p></p> <p></p> ‘I am willing to amuse you, if I can, sir—quite willing; but I cannot introduce a topic, because how do I know what will interest you? Ask me questions, and I will do my best to answer them.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Then, in the first place, do you agree with me that I have a right to be a little masterful, abrupt, perhaps exacting, sometimes, on the grounds I stated, namely, that I am old enough to be your father, and that I have battled through a varied experience with many men of many nations, and roamed over half the globe, while you have lived quietly with one set of people in one house?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Do as you please, sir.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘That is no answer; or rather it is a very irritating, because a very evasive one. Reply clearly.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘I don’t think, sir, you have a right to command me, merely because you are older than I, or because you have seen more of the world than I have; your claim to superi-ority depends on the use you have made of your time and experience.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Humph! Promptly spoken. But I won’t allow that, seeing that it would never suit my case, as I have made an indif-ferent, not to say a bad, use of both advantages. Leaving superiority out of the question, then, you must still agree to receive my orders now and then, without being piqued or hurt by the tone of command. Will you?’<p></p> <p></p> I smiled: I thought to myself Mr. Rochester IS peculiar— he seems to forget that he pays me 30 pounds per annum for<p></p>  
<p></p> 204	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
receiving his orders.<p></p> <p></p> ‘The smile is very well,’ said he, catching instantly the passing expression; ‘but speak too.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘I was thinking, sir, that very few masters would trouble themselves to inquire whether or not their paid subordi-nates were piqued and hurt by their orders.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Paid subordinates! What! you are my paid subordinate, are you? Oh yes, I had forgotten the salary! Well then, on that mercenary ground, will you agree to let me hector a little?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘No, sir, not on that ground; but, on the ground that you did forget it, and that you care whether or not a dependent is comfortable in his dependency, I agree heartily.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘And will you consent to dispense with a great many con-ventional forms and phrases, without thinking that the omission arises from insolence?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘I am sure, sir, I should never mistake informality for in-solence: one I rather like, the other nothing free-born would submit to, even for a salary.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Humbug! Most things free-born will submit to any-thing for a salary; therefore, keep to yourself, and don’t venture on generalities of which you are intensely igno-rant. However, I mentally shake hands with you for your answer, despite its inaccuracy; and as much for the manner in which it was said, as for the substance of the speech; the manner was frank and sincere; one does not often see such a manner: no, on the contrary, affectation, or coldness, or stupid, coarse-minded misapprehension of one’s meaning are the usual rewards of candour. Not three in three thou-<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	205<p></p>  
sand raw school-girl-governesses would have answered me as you have just done. But I don’t mean to flatter you: if you are cast in a different mould to the majority, it is no merit of yours: Nature did it. And then, after all, I go too fast in my conclusions: for what I yet know, you may be no better than the rest; you may have intolerable defects to counterbalance your few good points.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘And so may you,’ I thought. My eye met his as the idea crossed my mind: he seemed to read the glance, answering as if its import had been spoken as well as imagined—<p></p> <p></p> ‘Yes, yes, you are right,’ said he; ‘I have plenty of faults of my own: I know it, and I don’t wish to palliate them, I assure you. God wot I need not be too severe about oth-ers; I have a past existence, a series of deeds, a colour of life to contemplate within my own breast, which might well call my sneers and censures from my neighbours to myself. I started, or rather (for like other defaulters, I like to lay half the blame on ill fortune and adverse circumstances) was thrust on to a wrong tack at the age of one-and- twen-ty, and have never recovered the right course since: but I might have been very different; I might have been as good as you— wiser—almost as stainless. I envy you your peace of mind, your clean conscience, your unpolluted memory. Little girl, a memory without blot or contamination must be an exquisite treasure—an inexhaustible source of pure refreshment: is it not?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘How was your memory when you were eighteen, sir?’ ‘All right then; limpid, salubrious: no gush of bilge water<p></p> <p></p> had turned it to fetid puddle. I was your equal at eighteen—<p></p>  
<p></p> 206	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
quite your equal. Nature meant me to be, on the whole, a good man, Miss Eyre; one of the better kind, and you see I am not so. You would say you don’t see it; at least I flatter myself I read as much in your eye (beware, by-the-bye, what you express with that organ; I am quick at interpreting its language). Then take my word for it,—I am not a villain: you are not to suppose that—not to attribute to me any such bad eminence; but, owing, I verily believe, rather to circum-stances than to my natural bent, I am a trite commonplace sinner, hackneyed in all the poor petty dissipations with which the rich and worthless try to put on life. Do you won-der that I avow this to you? Know, that in the course of your future life you will often find yourself elected the involun-tary confidant of your acquaintances’ secrets: people will instinctively find out, as I have done, that it is not your forte to tell of yourself, but to listen while others talk of them-selves; they will feel, too, that you listen with no malevolent scorn of their indiscretion, but with a kind of innate sym-pathy; not the less comforting and encouraging because it is very unobtrusive in its manifestations.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘How do you know?—how can you guess all this, sir?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘I know it well; therefore I proceed almost as freely as if I were writing my thoughts in a diary. You would say, I should have been superior to circumstances; so I should— so I should; but you see I was not. When fate wronged me, I had not the wisdom to remain cool: I turned desperate; then I degenerated. Now, when any vicious simpleton excites my disgust by his paltry ribaldry, I cannot flatter myself that I am better than he: I am forced to confess that he and I are<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	207<p></p>  
on a level. I wish I had stood firm—God knows I do! Dread remorse when you are tempted to err, Miss Eyre; remorse is the poison of life.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Repentance is said to be its cure, sir.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘It is not its cure. Reformation may be its cure; and I could reform—I have strength yet for that—if—but where is the use of thinking of it, hampered, burdened, cursed as I am? Besides, since happiness is irrevocably denied me, I have a right to get pleasure out of life: and I WILL get it, cost what it may.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Then you will degenerate still more, sir.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Possibly: yet why should I, if I can get sweet, fresh plea-sure? And I may get it as sweet and fresh as the wild honey the bee gathers on the moor.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘It will sting—it will taste bitter, sir.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘How do you know?—you never tried it. How very seri-ous—how very solemn you look: and you are as ignorant of the matter as this cameo head’ (taking one from the man-telpiece). ‘You have no right to preach to me, you neophyte, that have not passed the porch of life, and are absolutely un-acquainted with its mysteries.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘I only remind you of your own words, sir: you said error brought remorse, and you pronounced remorse the poison of existence.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘And who talks of error now? I scarcely think the notion that flittered across my brain was an error. I believe it was an inspiration rather than a temptation: it was very genial, very soothing—I know that. Here it comes again! It is no devil, I assure you; or if it be, it has put on the robes of an<p></p>  
<p></p> 208	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
angel of light. I think I must admit so fair a guest when it asks entrance to my heart.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Distrust it, sir; it is not a true angel.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Once more, how do you know? By what instinct do you pretend to distinguish between a fallen seraph of the abyss and a messenger from the eternal throne—between a guide and a seducer?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘I judged by your countenance, sir, which was troubled when you said the suggestion had returned upon you. I feel sure it will work you more misery if you listen to it.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Not at all—it bears the most gracious message in the world: for the rest, you are not my conscience-keeper, so don’t make yourself uneasy. Here, come in, bonny wander-er!’<p></p> <p></p> He said this as if he spoke to a vision, viewless to any eye but his own; then, folding his arms, which he had half ex-tended, on his chest, he seemed to enclose in their embrace the invisible being.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Now,’ he continued, again addressing me, ‘I have re-ceived the pilgrim—a disguised deity, as I verify believe. Already it has done me good: my heart was a sort of charnel; it will now be a shrine.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘To speak truth, sir, I don’t understand you at all: I can-not keep up the conversation, because it has got out of my depth. Only one thing, I know: you said you were not as good as you should like to be, and that you regretted your own imperfection;—one thing I can comprehend: you inti-mated that to have a sullied memory was a perpetual bane. It seems to me, that if you tried hard, you would in time find<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	209<p></p>  
it possible to become what you yourself would approve; and that if from this day you began with resolution to correct your thoughts and actions, you would in a few years have laid up a new and stainless store of recollections, to which you might revert with pleasure.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Justly thought; rightly said, Miss Eyre; and, at this mo-ment, I am paving hell with energy.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Sir?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘I am laying down good intentions, which I believe du-rable as flint. Certainly, my associates and pursuits shall be other than they have been.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘And better?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘And better—so much better as pure ore is than foul dross. You seem to doubt me; I don’t doubt myself: I know what my aim is, what my motives are; and at this moment I pass a law, unalterable as that of the Medes and Persians, that both are right.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘They cannot be, sir, if they require a new statute to le-galise them.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘They are, Miss Eyre, though they absolutely require a new statute: unheard-of combinations of circumstances de-mand unheard-of rules.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘That sounds a dangerous maxim, sir; because one can see at once that it is liable to abuse.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Sententious sage! so it is: but I swear by my household gods not to abuse it.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘You are human and fallible.’ ‘I am: so are you—what then?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘The human and fallible should not arrogate a power with<p></p>  
<p></p> 210	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
which the divine and perfect alone can be safely intrusted.’ ‘What power?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘That of saying of any strange, unsanctioned line of ac-tion,—‘Let it be right.’’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Let it be right’—the very words: you have pronounced them.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘MAY it be right then,’ I said, as I rose, deeming it useless to continue a discourse which was all darkness to me; and, besides, sensible that the character of my interlocutor was beyond my penetration; at least, beyond its present reach; and feeling the uncertainty, the vague sense of insecurity, which accompanies a conviction of ignorance.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Where are you going?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘To put Adele to bed: it is past her bedtime.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘You are afraid of me, because I talk like a Sphynx.’ ‘Your language is enigmatical, sir: but though I am be-<p></p> <p></p> wildered, I am certainly not afraid.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘You ARE afraid—your self-love dreads a blunder.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘In that sense I do feel apprehensive—I have no wish to talk nonsense.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘If you did, it would be in such a grave, quiet manner, I should mistake it for sense. Do you never laugh, Miss Eyre? Don’t trouble yourself to answer—I see you laugh rarely; but you can laugh very merrily: believe me, you are not nat-urally austere, any more than I am naturally vicious. The Lowood constraint still clings to you somewhat; control-ling your features, muffling your voice, and restricting your limbs; and you fear in the presence of a man and a brother— or father, or master, or what you will—to smile too gaily,<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	211<p></p>  
speak too freely, or move too quickly: but, in time, I think you will learn to be natural with me, as I find it impossi-ble to be conventional with you; and then your looks and movements will have more vivacity and variety than they dare offer now. I see at intervals the glance of a curious sort of bird through the close-set bars of a cage: a vivid, restless, resolute captive is there; were it but free, it would soar cloud-high. You are still bent on going?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘It has struck nine, sir.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Never mind,—wait a minute: Adele is not ready to go to bed yet. My position, Miss Eyre, with my back to the fire, and my face to the room, favours observation. While talk-ing to you, I have also occasionally watched Adele (I have my own reasons for thinking her a curious study,—reasons that I may, nay, that I shall, impart to you some day). She pulled out of her box, about ten minutes ago, a little pink silk frock; rapture lit her face as she unfolded it; coquetry runs in her blood, blends with her brains, and seasons the marrow of her bones. ‘Il faut que je l’essaie!’ cried she, ‘et e l’instant meme!’ and she rushed out of the room. She is now with Sophie, undergoing a robing process: in a few minutes she will re- enter; and I know what I shall see,—a miniature of Celine Varens, as she used to appear on the boards at the rising of— But never mind that. However, my tenderest feelings are about to receive a shock: such is my presenti-ment; stay now, to see whether it will be realised.’<p></p> <p></p> Ere long, Adele’s little foot was heard tripping across the hall. She entered, transformed as her guardian had predict-ed. A dress of rose-coloured satin, very short, and as full in<p></p>

the skirt as it could be gathered, replaced the brown frock she had previously worn; a wreath of rosebuds circled her forehead; her feet were dressed in silk stockings and small white satin sandals.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Est- ce que ma robe va bien?’ cried she, bounding for-wards; ‘et mes souliers? et mes bas? Tenez, je crois que je vais danser!’<p></p> <p></p> And spreading out her dress, she chasseed across the room till, having reached Mr. Rochester, she wheeled light-ly round before him on tip-toe, then dropped on one knee at his feet, exclaiming—<p></p> <p></p> ‘Monsieur, je vous remercie mille fois de votre bonte;’ then rising, she added, ‘C’est comme cela que maman fai-sait, n’est-ce pas, monsieur?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Pre-cise-ly!’ was the answer; ‘and, ‘comme cela,’ she charmed my English gold out of my British breeches’ pock-et. I have been green, too, Miss Eyre,—ay, grass green: not a more vernal tint freshens you now than once freshened me. My Spring is gone, however, but it has left me that French floweret on my hands, which, in some moods, I would fain be rid of. Not valuing now the root whence it sprang; hav-ing found that it was of a sort which nothing but gold dust could manure, I have but half a liking to the blossom, es-pecially when it looks so artificial as just now. I keep it and rear it rather on the Roman Catholic principle of expiating numerous sins, great or small, by one good work. I’ll ex-plain all this some day. Good- night.’<p></p>

Chapter XV<p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> Mr. Rochester did, on a future occasion, explain it. It was one afternoon, when he chanced to meet me and Adele in the grounds: and while she played with Pilot and her shuttlecock, he asked me to walk up and down a long<p></p> <p></p> beech avenue within sight of her.<p></p> <p></p> He then said that she was the daughter of a French op-era-dancer, Celine Varens, towards whom he had once cherished what he called a ‘grande passion.’ This passion Celine had professed to return with even superior ardour. He thought himself her idol, ugly as he was: he believed, as he said, that she preferred his ‘taille d’athlete’ to the ele-gance of the Apollo Belvidere.<p></p> <p></p> ‘And, Miss Eyre, so much was I flattered by this preference of the Gallic sylph for her British gnome, that I installed her in an hotel; gave her a complete establishment of servants, a carriage, cashmeres, diamonds, dentelles, &c. In short, I began the process of ruining myself in the received style, like any other spoony. I had not, it seems, the originality to chalk out a new road to shame and destruction, but trode the old track with stupid exactness not to deviate an inch from the beaten centre. I had—as I deserved to have—the fate of all other spoonies. Happening to call one evening when Celine did not expect me, I found her out; but it was a warm night, and I was tired with strolling through Par-<p></p>

is, so I sat down in her boudoir; happy to breathe the air consecrated so lately by her presence. No,—I exaggerate; I never thought there was any consecrating virtue about her: it was rather a sort of pastille perfume she had left; a scent of musk and amber, than an odour of sanctity. I was just be-ginning to stifle with the fumes of conservatory flowers and sprinkled essences, when I bethought myself to open the window and step out on to the balcony. It was moonlight and gaslight besides, and very still and serene. The balcony was furnished with a chair or two; I sat down, and took out a cigar,—I will take one now, if you will excuse me.’<p></p> <p></p> Here ensued a pause, filled up by the producing and lighting of a cigar; having placed it to his lips and breathed a trail of Havannah incense on the freezing and sunless air, he went on—<p></p> <p></p> ‘I liked bonbons too in those days, Miss Eyre, and I was croquant— (overlook the barbarism)—croquant chocolate comfits, and smoking alternately, watching meantime the equipages that rolled along the fashionable streets towards the neighbouring opera-house, when in an elegant close carriage drawn by a beautiful pair of English horses, and distinctly seen in the brilliant city-night, I recognised the ‘voiture’ I had given Celine. She was returning: of course my heart thumped with impatience against the iron rails I leant upon. The carriage stopped, as I had expected, at the hotel door; my flame (that is the very word for an opera inamo-rata) alighted: though muffed in a cloak—an unnecessary encumbrance, by-the-bye, on so warm a June evening—I knew her instantly by her little foot, seen peeping from the<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	215<p></p>  
skirt of her dress, as she skipped from the carriage-step. Bending over the balcony, I was about to murmur ‘Mon ange’—in a tone, of course, which should be audible to the ear of love alone—when a figure jumped from the carriage after her; cloaked also; but that was a spurred heel which had rung on the pavement, and that was a hatted head which now passed under the arched porte cochere of the hotel.<p></p> <p></p> ‘You never felt jealousy, did you, Miss Eyre? Of course not: I need not ask you; because you never felt love. You have both sentiments yet to experience: your soul sleeps; the shock is yet to be given which shall waken it. You think all existence lapses in as quiet a flow as that in which your youth has hitherto slid away. Floating on with closed eyes and muffled ears, you neither see the rocks bristling not far off in the bed of the flood, nor hear the breakers boil at their base. But I tell you—and you may mark my words—you will come some day to a craggy pass in the channel, where the whole of life’s stream will be broken up into whirl and tu-mult, foam and noise: either you will be dashed to atoms on crag points, or lifted up and borne on by some master-wave into a calmer currentas I am now.<p></p> <p></p> ‘I like this day; I like that sky of steel; I like the sternness and stillness of the world under this frost. I like Thornfield, its antiquity, its retirement, its old crow-trees and thorn-trees, its grey facade, and lines of dark windows reflecting that metal welkin: and yet how long have I abhorred the very thought of it, shunned it like a great plague-house? How I do still abhor—.’<p></p> <p></p> He ground his teeth and was silent: he arrested his step<p></p>  
<p></p> 216	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
and struck his boot against the hard ground. Some hated thought seemed to have him in its grip, and to hold him so tightly that he could not advance.<p></p> <p></p> We were ascending the avenue when he thus paused; the hall was before us. Lifting his eye to its battlements, he cast over them a glare such as I never saw before or since. Pain, shame, ire, impatience, disgust, detestation, seemed momentarily to hold a quivering conflict in the large pu-pil dilating under his ebon eyebrow. Wild was the wrestle which should be paramount; but another feeling rose and triumphed: something hard and cynical: self-willed and resolute: it settled his passion and petrified his countenance: he went on—<p></p> <p></p> ‘During the moment I was silent, Miss Eyre, I was ar-ranging a point with my destiny. She stood there, by that beech-trunk—a hag like one of those who appeared to Mac-beth on the heath of Forres. ‘You like Thornfield?’ she said, lifting her finger; and then she wrote in the air a memento, which ran in lurid hieroglyphics all along the house -front, between the upper and lower row of windows, ‘Like it if you can! Like it if you dare!’<p></p> <p></p> ‘I will like it,’ said I; ‘I dare like it;’ and’ (he subjoined moodily) ‘I will keep my word; I will break obstacles to happiness, to goodness—yes, goodness. I wish to be a better man than I have been, than I am; as Job’s leviathan broke the spear, the dart, and the habergeon, hindrances which others count as iron and brass, I will esteem but straw and rotten wood.’<p></p> <p></p> Adele here ran before him with her shuttlecock. ‘Away!’<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	217<p></p>  
he cried harshly; ‘keep at a distance, child; or go in to So-phie!’ Continuing then to pursue his walk in silence, I ventured to recall him to the point whence he had abruptly diverged—<p></p> <p></p> ‘Did you leave the balcony, sir,’ I asked, ‘when Mdlle. Va-rens entered?’<p></p> <p></p> I almost expected a rebuff for this hardly well-timed question, but, on the contrary, waking out of his scowling abstraction, he turned his eyes towards me, and the shade seemed to clear off his brow. ‘Oh, I had forgotten Celine! Well, to resume. When I saw my charmer thus come in ac-companied by a cavalier, I seemed to hear a hiss, and the green snake of jealousy, rising on undulating coils from the moonlit balcony, glided within my waistcoat, and ate its way in two minutes to my heart’s core. Strange!’ he ex-claimed, suddenly starting again from the point. ‘Strange that I should choose you for the confidant of all this, young lady; passing strange that you should listen to me quietly, as if it were the most usual thing in the world for a man like me to tell stories of his opera-mistresses to a quaint, inex-perienced girl like you! But the last singularity explains the first, as I intimated once before: you, with your gravity, con-siderateness, and caution were made to be the recipient of secrets. Besides, I know what sort of a mind I have placed in communication with my own: I know it is one not liable to take infection: it is a peculiar mind: it is a unique one. Hap-pily I do not mean to harm it: but, if I did, it would not take harm from me. The more you and I converse, the better; for while I cannot blight you, you may refresh me.’ After this<p></p>  
<p></p> 218	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
digression he proceeded—<p></p> <p></p> ‘I remained in the balcony. ‘They will come to her bou-doir, no doubt,’ thought I: ‘let me prepare an ambush.’ So putting my hand in through the open window, I drew the curtain over it, leaving only an opening through which I could take observations; then I closed the casement, all but a chink just wide enough to furnish an outlet to lov-ers’ whispered vows: then I stole back to my chair; and as I resumed it the pair came in. My eye was quickly at the ap-erture. Celine’s chamber-maid entered, lit a lamp, left it on the table, and withdrew. The couple were thus revealed to me clearly: both removed their cloaks, and there was ‘the Varens,’ shining in satin and jewels,—my gifts of course,— and there was her companion in an officer’s uniform; and I knew him for a young roue of a vicomte—a brainless and vicious youth whom I had sometimes met in society, and had never thought of hating because I despised him so ab-solutely. On recognising him, the fang of the snake Jealousy was instantly broken; because at the same moment my love for Celine sank under an extinguisher. A woman who could betray me for such a rival was not worth contending for; she deserved only scorn; less, however, than I, who had been her dupe.<p></p> <p></p> ‘They began to talk; their conversation eased me com-pletely: frivolous, mercenary, heartless, and senseless, it was rather calculated to weary than enrage a listener. A card of mine lay on the table; this being perceived, brought my name under discussion. Neither of them possessed ener-gy or wit to belabour me soundly, but they insulted me as<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	219<p></p>  
coarsely as they could in their little way: especially Celine, who even waxed rather brilliant on my personal defects— deformities she termed them. Now it had been her custom to launch out into fervent admiration of what she called my ‘beaute male:’ wherein she differed diametrically from you, who told me point-blank, at the second interview, that you did not think me handsome. The contrast struck me at the time and—‘<p></p> <p></p> Adele here came running up again.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Monsieur, John has just been to say that your agent has called and wishes to see you.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Ah! in that case I must abridge. Opening the window, I walked in upon them; liberated Celine from my protec-tion; gave her notice to vacate her hotel; offered her a purse for immediate exigencies; disregarded screams, hysterics, prayers, protestations, convulsions; made an appointment with the vicomte for a meeting at the Bois de Boulogne. Next morning I had the pleasure of encountering him; left a bullet in one of his poor etiolated arms, feeble as the wing of a chicken in the pip, and then thought I had done with the whole crew. But unluckily the Varens, six months before, had given me this filette Adele, who, she affirmed, was my daughter; and perhaps she may be, though I see no proofs of such grim paternity written in her countenance: Pilot is more like me than she. Some years after I had broken with the mother, she abandoned her child, and ran away to It-aly with a musician or singer. I acknowledged no natural claim on Adele’s part to be supported by me, nor do I now acknowledge any, for I am not her father; but hearing that<p></p>  
<p></p> 220	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
she was quite destitute, I e’en took the poor thing out of the slime and mud of Paris, and transplanted it here, to grow up clean in the wholesome soil of an English country gar-den. Mrs. Fairfax found you to train it; but now you know that it is the illegitimate offspring of a French opera- girl, you will perhaps think differently of your post and prote-gee: you will be coming to me some day with notice that you have found another place—that you beg me to look out for a new governess, &c.Eh?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘No: Adele is not answerable for either her mother’s faults or yours: I have a regard for her; and now that I know she is, in a sense, parentless—forsaken by her mother and dis-owned by you, sir— I shall cling closer to her than before. How could I possibly prefer the spoilt pet of a wealthy fam-ily, who would hate her governess as a nuisance, to a lonely little orphan, who leans towards her as a friend?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Oh, that is the light in which you view it! Well, I must go in now; and you too: it darkens.’<p></p> <p></p> But I stayed out a few minutes longer with Adele and Pi-lot—ran a race with her, and played a game of battledore and shuttlecock. When we went in, and I had removed her bonnet and coat, I took her on my knee; kept her there an hour, allowing her to prattle as she liked: not rebuking even some little freedoms and trivialities into which she was apt to stray when much noticed, and which betrayed in her a superficiality of character, inherited probably from her mother, hardly congenial to an English mind. Still she had her merits; and I was disposed to appreciate all that was good in her to the utmost. I sought in her countenance and<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	221<p></p>  
features a likeness to Mr. Rochester, but found none: no trait, no turn of expression announced relationship. It was a pity: if she could but have been proved to resemble him, he would have thought more of her.<p></p> <p></p> It was not till after I had withdrawn to my own chamber for the night, that I steadily reviewed the tale Mr. Rochester had told me. As he had said, there was probably nothing at all extraordinary in the substance of the narrative itself: a wealthy Englishman’s passion for a French dancer, and her treachery to him, were every- day matters enough, no doubt, in society; but there was something decidedly strange in the paroxysm of emotion which had suddenly seized him when he was in the act of expressing the present contentment of his mood, and his newly revived pleasure in the old hall and its environs. I meditated wonderingly on this incident; but gradually quitting it, as I found it for the present inexpli-cable, I turned to the consideration of my master’s manner to myself. The confidence he had thought fit to repose in me seemed a tribute to my discretion: I regarded and accepted it as such. His deportment had now for some weeks been more uniform towards me than at the first. I never seemed in his way; he did not take fits of chilling hauteur: when he met me unexpectedly, the encounter seemed welcome; he had always a word and sometimes a smile for me: when summoned by formal invitation to his presence, I was hon-oured by a cordiality of reception that made me feel I really possessed the power to amuse him, and that these evening conferences were sought as much for his pleasure as for my benefit.<p></p>  
<p></p> 222	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
I, indeed, talked comparatively little, but I heard him talk with relish. It was his nature to be communicative; he liked to open to a mind unacquainted with the world glimpses of its scenes and ways (I do not mean its corrupt scenes and wicked ways, but such as derived their interest from the great scale on which they were acted, the strange novelty by which they were characterised); and I had a keen delight in receiving the new ideas he offered, in imagin-ing the new pictures he portrayed, and following him in thought through the new regions he disclosed, never star-tled or troubled by one noxious allusion.<p></p> <p></p> The ease of his manner freed me from painful restraint: the friendly frankness, as correct as cordial, with which he treated me, drew me to him. I felt at times as if he were my relation rather than my master: yet he was imperious sometimes still; but I did not mind that; I saw it was his way. So happy, so gratified did I become with this new interest added to life, that I ceased to pine after kindred: my thin crescent-destiny seemed to enlarge; the blanks of existence were filled up; my bodily health improved; I gathered flesh and strength.<p></p> <p></p> And was Mr. Rochester now ugly in my eyes? No, reader: gratitude, and many associations, all pleasurable and genial, made his face the object I best liked to see; his presence in a room was more cheering than the brightest fire. Yet I had not forgotten his faults; indeed, I could not, for he brought them frequently before me. He was proud, sardonic, harsh to inferiority of every description: in my secret soul I knew that his great kindness to me was balanced by unjust sever-<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	223<p></p>  
ity to many others. He was moody, too; unaccountably so; I more than once, when sent for to read to him, found him sitting in his library alone, with his head bent on his folded arms; and, when he looked up, a morose, almost a malig-nant, scowl blackened his features. But I believed that his moodiness, his harshness, and his former faults of moral-ity (I say FORMER, for now he seemed corrected of them) had their source in some cruel cross of fate. I believed he was naturally a man of better tendencies, higher principles, and purer tastes than such as circumstances had developed, education instilled, or destiny encouraged. I thought there were excellent materials in him; though for the present they hung together somewhat spoiled and tangled. I cannot deny that I grieved for his grief, whatever that was, and would have given much to assuage it.<p></p> <p></p> Though I had now extinguished my candle and was laid down in bed, I could not sleep for thinking of his look when he paused in the avenue, and told how his destiny had risen up before him, and dared him to be happy at Thornfield.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Why not?’ I asked myself. ‘What alienates him from the house? Will he leave it again soon? Mrs. Fairfax said he sel-dom stayed here longer than a fortnight at a time; and he has now been resident eight weeks. If he does go, the change will be doleful. Suppose he should be absent spring, sum-mer, and autumn: how joyless sunshine and fine days will seem!’<p></p> <p></p> I hardly know whether I had slept or not after this musing; at any rate, I started wide awake on hearing a vague mur-mur, peculiar and lugubrious, which sounded, I thought,<p></p>  
<p></p> 224	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
just above me. I wished I had kept my candle burning: the night was drearily dark; my spirits were depressed. I rose and sat up in bed, listening. The sound was hushed.<p></p> <p></p> I tried again to sleep; but my heart beat anxiously: my inward tranquillity was broken. The clock, far down in the hall, struck two. Just then it seemed my chamber-door was touched; as if fingers had swept the panels in groping a way along the dark gallery outside. I said, ‘Who is there?’ Noth-ing answered. I was chilled with fear.<p></p> <p></p> All at once I remembered that it might be Pilot, who, when the kitchen-door chanced to be left open, not unfre-quently found his way up to the threshold of Mr. Rochester’s chamber: I had seen him lying there myself in the morn-ings. The idea calmed me somewhat: I lay down. Silence composes the nerves; and as an unbroken hush now reigned again through the whole house, I began to feel the return of slumber. But it was not fated that I should sleep that night. A dream had scarcely approached my ear, when it fled af-frighted, scared by a marrow-freezing incident enough.<p></p> <p></p> This was a demoniac laugh—low, suppressed, and deep— uttered, as it seemed, at the very keyhole of my chamber door. The head of my bed was near the door, and I thought at first the goblin-laugher stood at my bedside—or rather, crouched by my pillow: but I rose, looked round, and could see nothing; while, as I still gazed, the unnatural sound was reiterated: and I knew it came from behind the panels. My first impulse was to rise and fasten the bolt; my next, again to cry out, ‘Who is there?’<p></p> <p></p> Something gurgled and moaned. Ere long, steps retreat-<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	225<p></p>  
ed up the gallery towards the third-storey staircase: a door had lately been made to shut in that staircase; I heard it open and close, and all was still.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Was that Grace Poole? and is she possessed with a dev-il?’ thought I. Impossible now to remain longer by myself: I must go to Mrs. Fairfax. I hurried on my frock and a shawl; I withdrew the bolt and opened the door with a trembling hand. There was a candle burning just outside, and on the matting in the gallery. I was surprised at this circumstance: but still more was I amazed to perceive the air quite dim, as if filled with smoke; and, while looking to the right hand and left, to find whence these blue wreaths issued, I became further aware of a strong smell of burning.<p></p> <p></p> Something creaked: it was a door ajar; and that door was Mr. Rochester’s, and the smoke rushed in a cloud from thence. I thought no more of Mrs. Fairfax; I thought no more of Grace Poole, or the laugh: in an instant, I was with-in the chamber. Tongues of flame darted round the bed: the curtains were on fire. In the midst of blaze and vapour, Mr. Rochester lay stretched motionless, in deep sleep.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Wake! wake!’ I cried. I shook him, but he only mur-mured and turned: the smoke had stupefied him. Not a moment could be lost: the very sheets were kindling, I rushed to his basin and ewer; fortunately, one was wide and the other deep, and both were filled with water. I heaved them up, deluged the bed and its occupant, flew back to my own room, brought my own water-jug, baptized the couch afresh, and, by God’s aid, succeeded in extinguishing the flames which were devouring it.<p></p>  
<p></p> 226	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
The hiss of the quenched element, the breakage of a pitcher which I flung from my hand when I had emptied it, and, above all, the splash of the shower-bath I had liberally bestowed, roused Mr. Rochester at last. Though it was now dark, I knew he was awake; because I heard him fulminat-ing strange anathemas at finding himself lying in a pool of water.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Is there a flood?’ he cried.<p></p> <p></p> ‘No, sir,’ I answered; ‘but there has been a fire: get up, do; you are quenched now; I will fetch you a candle.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘In the name of all the elves in Christendom, is that Jane Eyre?’ he demanded. ‘What have you done with me, witch, sorceress? Who is in the room besides you? Have you plot-ted to drown me?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘I will fetch you a candle, sir; and, in Heaven’s name, get up. Somebody has plotted something: you cannot too soon find out who and what it is.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘There! I am up now; but at your peril you fetch a can-dle yet: wait two minutes till I get into some dry garments, if any dry there be—yes, here is my dressing-gown. Now run!’<p></p> <p></p> I did run; I brought the candle which still remained in the gallery. He took it from my hand, held it up, and surveyed the bed, all blackened and scorched, the sheets drenched, the carpet round swimming in water.<p></p> <p></p> ‘What is it? and who did it?’ he asked. I briefly related to him what had transpired: the strange laugh I had heard in the gallery: the step ascending to the third storey; the smoke,—the smell of fire which had conducted me to his<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	227<p></p>  
room; in what state I had found matters there, and how I had deluged him with all the water I could lay hands on.<p></p> <p></p> He listened very gravely; his face, as I went on, expressed more concern than astonishment; he did not immediately speak when I had concluded.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Shall I call Mrs. Fairfax?’ I asked.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Mrs. Fairfax? No; what the deuce would you call her for? What can she do? Let her sleep unmolested.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Then I will fetch Leah, and wake John and his wife.’ ‘Not at all: just be still. You have a shawl on. If you are<p></p> <p></p> not warm enough, you may take my cloak yonder; wrap it about you, and sit down in the arm-chair: there,—I will put it on. Now place your feet on the stool, to keep them out of the wet. I am going to leave you a few minutes. I shall take the candle. Remain where you are till I return; be as still as a mouse. I must pay a visit to the second storey. Don’t move, remember, or call any one.’<p></p> <p></p> He went: I watched the light withdraw. He passed up the gallery very softly, unclosed the staircase door with as little noise as possible, shut it after him, and the last ray vanished. I was left in total darkness. I listened for some noise, but heard nothing. A very long time elapsed. I grew weary: it was cold, in spite of the cloak; and then I did not see the use of staying, as I was not to rouse the house. I was on the point of risking Mr. Rochester’s displeasure by disobeying his orders, when the light once more gleamed dimly on the gallery wall, and I heard his unshod feet tread the matting. ‘I hope it is he,’ thought I, ‘and not something worse.’<p></p> <p></p> He re-entered, pale and very gloomy. ‘I have found it all<p></p>  
<p></p> 228	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
out,’ said he, setting his candle down on the washstand; ‘it is as I thought.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘How, sir?’<p></p> <p></p> He made no reply, but stood with his arms folded, look-ing on the ground. At the end of a few minutes he inquired in rather a peculiar tone—<p></p> <p></p> ‘I forget whether you said you saw anything when you opened your chamber door.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘No, sir, only the candlestick on the ground.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘But you heard an odd laugh? You have heard that laugh before, I should think, or something like it?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Yes, sir: there is a woman who sews here, called Grace Poole,—she laughs in that way. She is a singular person.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Just so. Grace Poole—you have guessed it. She is, as you say, singular—very. Well, I shall reflect on the subject. Meantime, I am glad that you are the only person, besides myself, acquainted with the precise details of to-night’s in-cident. You are no talking fool: say nothing about it. I will account for this state of affairs’ (pointing to the bed): ‘and now return to your own room. I shall do very well on the sofa in the library for the rest of the night. It is near four:- in two hours the servants will be up.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Good-night, then, sir,’ said I, departing.<p></p> <p></p> He seemed surprised—very inconsistently so, as he had just told me to go.<p></p> <p></p> ‘What!’ he exclaimed, ‘are you quitting me already, and in that way?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘You said I might go, sir.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘But not without taking leave; not without a word or two<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	229<p></p>  
of acknowledgment and good-will: not, in short, in that brief, dry fashion. Why, you have saved my life!—snatched me from a horrible and excruciating death! and you walk past me as if we were mutual strangers! At least shake hands.’<p></p> <p></p> He held out his hand; I gave him mine: he took it first in one, them in both his own.<p></p> <p></p> ‘You have saved my life: I have a pleasure in owing you so immense a debt. I cannot say more. Nothing else that has being would have been tolerable to me in the character of creditor for such an obligation: but you: it is different;—I feel your benefits no burden, Jane.’<p></p> <p></p> He paused; gazed at me: words almost visible trembled on his lips,but his voice was checked.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Good-night again, sir. There is no debt, benefit, burden, obligation, in the case.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘I knew,’ he continued, ‘you would do me good in some way, at some time;—I saw it in your eyes when I first be-held you: their expression and smile did not’—(again he stopped) —‘did not’ (he proceeded hastily) ‘strike delight to my very inmost heart so for nothing. People talk of natu-ral sympathies; I have heard of good genii: there are grains of truth in the wildest fable. My cherished preserver, good-night!’<p></p> <p></p> Strange energy was in his voice, strange fire in his look. ‘I am glad I happened to be awake,’ I said: and then I was<p></p> <p></p> going.<p></p> <p></p> ‘What! you WILL go?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘I am cold, sir.’<p></p>

‘Cold? Yes,—and standing in a pool! Go, then, Jane; go!’ But he still retained my hand, and I could not free it. I be-thought myself of an expedient.<p></p> <p></p> ‘I think I hear Mrs. Fairfax move, sir,’ said I.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Well, leave me:’ he relaxed his fingers, and I was gone.<p></p> <p></p> I regained my couch, but never thought of sleep. Till morning dawned I was tossed on a buoyant but unquiet sea, where billows of trouble rolled under surges of joy. I thought sometimes I saw beyond its wild waters a shore, sweet as the hills of Beulah; and now and then a freshening gale, wak-ened by hope, bore my spirit triumphantly towards the bourne: but I could not reach it, even in fancy—a counter-acting breeze blew off land, and continually drove me back. Sense would resist delirium: judgment would warn passion. Too feverish to rest, I rose as soon as day dawned.<p></p>

Chapter XVI<p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> I both wished and feared to see Mr. Rochester on the day which followed this sleepless night: I wanted to hear his voice again, yet feared to meet his eye. During the early part of the morning, I momentarily expected his coming; he was not in the frequent habit of entering the schoolroom, but he did step in for a few minutes sometimes, and I had the im-<p></p> <p></p> pression that he was sure to visit it that day.<p></p> <p></p> But the morning passed just as usual: nothing happened to interrupt the quiet course of Adele’s studies; only soon after breakfast, I heard some bustle in the neighbourhood of Mr. Rochester’s chamber, Mrs. Fairfax’s voice, and Le-ah’s, and the cook’s—that is, John’s wife—and even John’s own gruff tones. There were exclamations of ‘What a mercy master was not burnt in his bed!’ ‘It is always dangerous to keep a candle lit at night.’ ‘How providential that he had presence of mind to think of the water-jug!’ ‘I wonder he waked nobody!’ ‘It is to be hoped he will not take cold with sleeping on the library sofa,’ &c.<p></p> <p></p> To much confabulation succeeded a sound of scrubbing and setting to rights; and when I passed the room, in go-ing downstairs to dinner, I saw through the open door that all was again restored to complete order; only the bed was stripped of its hangings. Leah stood up in the window-seat, rubbing the panes of glass dimmed with smoke. I was about<p></p>  
<p></p> 232	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
to address her, for I wished to know what account had been given of the affair: but, on advancing, I saw a second person in the chamber—a woman sitting on a chair by the bedside, and sewing rings to new curtains. That woman was no oth-er than Grace Poole.<p></p> <p></p> There she sat, staid and taciturn-looking, as usual, in her brown stuff gown, her check apron, white handkerchief, and cap. She was intent on her work, in which her whole thoughts seemed absorbed: on her hard forehead, and in her commonplace features, was nothing either of the pale-ness or desperation one would have expected to see marking the countenance of a woman who had attempted murder, and whose intended victim had followed her last night to her lair, and (as I believed), charged her with the crime she wished to perpetrate. I was amazed—confounded. She looked up, while I still gazed at her: no start, no increase or failure of colour betrayed emotion, consciousness of guilt, or fear of detection. She said ‘Good morning, Miss,’ in her usual phlegmatic and brief manner; and taking up another ring and more tape, went on with her sewing.<p></p> <p></p> ‘I will put her to some test,’ thought I: ‘such absolute im-penetrability is past comprehension.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Good morning, Grace,’ I said. ‘Has anything happened here? I thought I heard the servants all talking together a while ago.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Only master had been reading in his bed last night; he fell asleep with his candle lit, and the curtains got on fire; but, fortunately, he awoke before the bed-clothes or the wood-work caught, and contrived to quench the flames<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	233<p></p>  
with the water in the ewer.<p></p> <p></p> ‘A strange affair!’ I said, in a low voice: then, looking at her fixedly—‘Did Mr. Rochester wake nobody? Did no one hear him move?’<p></p> <p></p> She again raised her eyes to me, and this time there was something of consciousness in their expression. She seemed to examine me warily; then she answered—<p></p> <p></p> ‘The servants sleep so far off, you know, Miss, they would not be likely to hear. Mrs. Fairfax’s room and yours are the nearest to master’s; but Mrs. Fairfax said she heard nothing: when people get elderly, they often sleep heavy.’ She paused, and then added, with a sort of assumed indifference, but still in a marked and significant tone—‘But you are young, Miss; and I should say a light sleeper: perhaps you may have heard a noise?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘I did,’ said I, dropping my voice, so that Leah, who was still polishing the panes, could not hear me, ‘and at first I thought it was Pilot: but Pilot cannot laugh; and I am cer-tain I heard a laugh, and a strange one.’<p></p> <p></p> She took a new needleful of thread, waxed it carefully, threaded her needle with a steady hand, and then observed, with perfect composure—<p></p> <p></p> ‘It is hardly likely master would laugh, I should think, Miss, when he was in such danger: You must have been dreaming.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘I was not dreaming,’ I said, with some warmth, for her brazen coolness provoked me. Again she looked at me; and with the same scrutinising and conscious eye.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Have you told master that you heard a laugh?’ she in-<p></p>  
<p></p> 234	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
quired.<p></p> <p></p> ‘I have not had the opportunity of speaking to him this morning.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘You did not think of opening your door and looking out into the gallery?’ she further asked.<p></p> <p></p> She appeared to be cross-questioning me, attempting to draw from me information unawares. The idea struck me that if she discovered I knew or suspected her guilt, she would be playing of some of her malignant pranks on me; I thought it advisable to be on my guard.<p></p> <p></p> ‘On the contrary,’ said I, ‘I bolted my door.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Then you are not in the habit of bolting your door every night before you get into bed?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Fiend! she wants to know my habits, that she may lay her plans accordingly!’ Indignation again prevailed over pru-dence: I replied sharply, ‘Hitherto I have often omitted to fasten the bolt: I did not think it necessary. I was not aware any danger or annoyance was to be dreaded at Thornfield Hall: but in future’ (and I laid marked stress on the words) ‘I shall take good care to make all secure before I venture to lie down.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘It will be wise so to do,’ was her answer: ‘this neigh-bourhood is as quiet as any I know, and I never heard of the hall being attempted by robbers since it was a house; though there are hundreds of pounds’ worth of plate in the plate-closet, as is well known. And you see, for such a large house, there are very few servants, because master has never lived here much; and when he does come, being a bachelor, he needs little waiting on: but I always think it best to err<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	235<p></p>  
on the safe side; a door is soon fastened, and it is as well to have a drawn bolt between one and any mischief that may be about. A deal of people, Miss, are for trusting all to Providence; but I say Providence will not dispense with the means, though He often blesses them when they are used discreetly.’ And here she closed her harangue: a long one for her, and uttered with the demureness of a Quakeress.<p></p> <p></p> I still stood absolutely dumfoundered at what appeared to me her miraculous self-possession and most inscrutable hypocrisy, when the cook entered.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Mrs. Poole,’ said she, addressing Grace, ‘the servants’ dinner will soon be ready: will you come down?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘No; just put my pint of porter and bit of pudding on a tray, and I’ll carry it upstairs.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘You’ll have some meat?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Just a morsel, and a taste of cheese, that’s all.’ ‘And the sago?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Never mind it at present: I shall be coming down before<p></p> <p></p> teatime: I’ll make it myself.’<p></p> <p></p> The cook here turned to me, saying that Mrs. Fairfax was waiting for me: so I departed.<p></p> <p></p> I hardly heard Mrs. Fairfax’s account of the curtain conflagration during dinner, so much was I occupied in puzzling my brains over the enigmatical character of Grace Poole, and still more in pondering the problem of her po-sition at Thornfield and questioning why she had not been given into custody that morning, or, at the very least, dis-missed from her master’s service. He had almost as much as declared his conviction of her criminality last night: what<p></p>  
<p></p> 236	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
mysterious cause withheld him from accusing her? Why had he enjoined me, too, to secrecy? It was strange: a bold, vindictive, and haughty gentleman seemed somehow in the power of one of the meanest of his dependants; so much in her power, that even when she lifted her hand against his life, he dared not openly charge her with the attempt, much less punish her for it.<p></p> <p></p> Had Grace been young and handsome, I should have been tempted to think that tenderer feelings than prudence or fear influenced Mr. Rochester in her behalf; but, hard-favoured and matronly as she was, the idea could not be admitted. ‘Yet,’ I reflected, ‘she has been young once; her youth would be contemporary with her master’s: Mrs. Fair-fax told me once, she had lived here many years. I don’t think she can ever have been pretty; but, for aught I know, she may possess originality and strength of character to com-pensate for the want of personal advantages. Mr. Rochester is an amateur of the decided and eccentric: Grace is eccen-tric at least. What if a former caprice (a freak very possible to a nature so sudden and headstrong as his) has delivered him into her power, and she now exercises over his actions a secret influence, the result of his own indiscretion, which he cannot shake off, and dare not disregard?’ But, having reached this point of conjecture, Mrs. Poole’s square, flat figure, and uncomely, dry, even coarse face, recurred so dis-tinctly to my mind’s eye, that I thought, ‘No; impossible! my supposition cannot be correct. Yet,’ suggested the secret voice which talks to us in our own hearts, ‘you are not beau-tiful either, and perhaps Mr. Rochester approves you: at any<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	237<p></p>  
rate, you have often felt as if he did; and last night—remem-ber his words; remember his look; remember his voice!’<p></p> <p></p> I well remembered all; language, glance, and tone seemed at the moment vividly renewed. I was now in the school-room; Adele was drawing; I bent over her and directed her pencil. She looked up with a sort of start.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Qu’ avez-vous, mademoiselle?’ said she. ‘Vos doigts tremblent comme la feuille, et vos joues sont rouges: mais, rouges comme des cerises!’<p></p> <p></p> ‘I am hot, Adele, with stooping!’ She went on sketching; I went on thinking.<p></p> <p></p> I hastened to drive from my mind the hateful notion I had been conceiving respecting Grace Poole; it disgusted me. I compared myself with her, and found we were differ-ent. Bessie Leaven had said I was quite a lady; and she spoke truth—I was a lady. And now I looked much better than I did when Bessie saw me; I had more colour and more flesh, more life, more vivacity, because I had brighter hopes and keener enjoyments.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Evening approaches,’ said I, as I looked towards the win-dow. ‘I have never heard Mr. Rochester’s voice or step in the house to-day; but surely I shall see him before night: I feared the meeting in the morning; now I desire it, because expectation has been so long baffled that it is grown impa-tient.’<p></p> <p></p> When dusk actually closed, and when Adele left me to go and play in the nursery with Sophie, I did most keenly de-sire it. I listened for the bell to ring below; I listened for Leah coming up with a message; I fancied sometimes I heard Mr.<p></p>  
<p></p> 238	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
Rochester’s own tread, and I turned to the door, expecting it to open and admit him. The door remained shut; dark-ness only came in through the window. Still it was not late; he often sent for me at seven and eight o’clock, and it was yet but six. Surely I should not be wholly disappointed to-night, when I had so many things to say to him! I wanted again to introduce the subject of Grace Poole, and to hear what he would answer; I wanted to ask him plainly if he re-ally believed it was she who had made last night’s hideous attempt; and if so, why he kept her wickedness a secret. It lit-tle mattered whether my curiosity irritated him; I knew the pleasure of vexing and soothing him by turns; it was one I chiefly delighted in, and a sure instinct always prevented me from going too far; beyond the verge of provocation I never ventured; on the extreme brink I liked well to try my skill. Retaining every minute form of respect, every propriety of my station, I could still meet him in argument without fear or uneasy restraint; this suited both him and me.<p></p> <p></p> A tread creaked on the stairs at last. Leah made her ap-pearance; but it was only to intimate that tea was ready in Mrs. Fairfax’s room. Thither I repaired, glad at least to go downstairs; for that brought me, I imagined, nearer to Mr. Rochester’s presence.<p></p> <p></p> ‘You must want your tea,’ said the good lady, as I joined her; ‘you ate so little at dinner. I am afraid,’ she continued, ‘you are not well to-day: you look flushed and feverish.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Oh, quite well! I never felt better.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Then you must prove it by evincing a good appetite; will you fill the teapot while I knit off this needle?’ Having com-<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	239<p></p>  
pleted her task, she rose to draw down the blind, which she had hitherto kept up, by way, I suppose, of making the most of daylight, though dusk was now fast deepening into total obscurity.<p></p> <p></p> ‘It is fair to-night,’ said she, as she looked through the panes, ‘though not starlight; Mr. Rochester has, on the whole, had a favourable day for his journey.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Journey!—Is Mr. Rochester gone anywhere? I did not know he was out.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Oh, he set of the moment he had breakfasted! He is gone to the Leas, Mr. Eshton’s place, ten miles on the other side Millcote. I believe there is quite a party assembled there; Lord Ingram, Sir George Lynn, Colonel Dent, and others.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Do you expect him back to-night?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘No—nor to -morrow either; I should think he is very likely to stay a week or more: when these fine, fashionable people get together, they are so surrounded by elegance and gaiety, so well provided with all that can please and enter-tain, they are in no hurry to separate. Gentlemen especially are often in request on such occasions; and Mr. Rochester is so talented and so lively in society, that I believe he is a gen-eral favourite: the ladies are very fond of him; though you would not think his appearance calculated to recommend him particularly in their eyes: but I suppose his acquire-ments and abilities, perhaps his wealth and good blood, make amends for any little fault of look.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Are there ladies at the Leas?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘There are Mrs. Eshton and her three daughters—very el-egant young ladies indeed; and there are the Honourable<p></p>  
<p></p> 240	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
Blanche and Mary Ingram, most beautiful women, I sup-pose: indeed I have seen Blanche, six or seven years since, when she was a girl of eighteen. She came here to a Christ-mas ball and party Mr. Rochester gave. You should have seen the dining-room that day—how richly it was decorated, how brilliantly lit up! I should think there were fifty ladies and gentlemen present—all of the first county families; and Miss Ingram was considered the belle of the evening.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘You saw her, you say, Mrs. Fairfax: what was she like?’ ‘Yes, I saw her. The  dining-room doors were thrown open; and, as it was Christmas -time, the servants were al-lowed to assemble in the hall, to hear some of the ladies sing and play. Mr. Rochester would have me to come in, and I sat down in a quiet corner and watched them. I never saw a more splendid scene: the ladies were magnificently dressed; most of them—at least most of the younger ones—looked<p></p> <p></p> handsome; but Miss Ingram was certainly the queen.’ ‘And what was she like?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Tall, fine bust, sloping shoulders; long, graceful neck: ol-ive complexion, dark and clear; noble features; eyes rather like Mr. Rochester’s: large and black, and as brilliant as her jewels. And then she had such a fine head of hair; raven-black and so becomingly arranged: a crown of thick plaits behind, and in front the longest, the glossiest curls I ever saw. She was dressed in pure white; an amber-coloured scarf was passed over her shoulder and across her breast, tied at the side, and descending in long, fringed ends below her knee. She wore an amber-coloured flower, too, in her hair: it contrasted well with the jetty mass of her curls.’<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	241<p></p>  
‘She was greatly admired, of course?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Yes, indeed: and not only for her beauty, but for her accomplishments. She was one of the ladies who sang: a gentleman accompanied her on the piano. She and Mr. Rochester sang a duet.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Mr. Rochester? I was not aware he could sing.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Oh! he has a fine bass voice, and an excellent taste for music.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘And Miss Ingram: what sort of a voice had she?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘A very rich and powerful one: she sang delightfully; it was a treat to listen to her;—and she played afterwards. I am no judge of music, but Mr. Rochester is; and I heard him say her execution was remarkably good.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘And this beautiful and accomplished lady, she is not yet married?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘It appears not: I fancy neither she nor her sister have very large fortunes. Old Lord Ingram’s estates were chiefly en-tailed, and the eldest son came in for everything almost.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘But I wonder no wealthy nobleman or gentleman has taken a fancy to her: Mr. Rochester, for instance. He is rich, is he not?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Oh! yes. But you see there is a considerable difference in age: Mr. Rochester is nearly forty; she is but twenty-five.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘What of that? More unequal matches are made every day.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘True: yet I should scarcely fancy Mr. Rochester would entertain an idea of the sort. But you eat nothing: you have scarcely tasted since you began tea.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘No: I am too thirsty to eat. Will you let me have another<p></p>  
<p></p> 242	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
cup?’<p></p> <p></p> I was about again to revert to the probability of a union between Mr. Rochester and the beautiful Blanche; but Adele came in, and the conversation was turned into an-other channel.<p></p> <p></p> When once more alone, I reviewed the information I had got; looked into my heart, examined its thoughts and feel-ings, and endeavoured to bring back with a strict hand such as had been straying through imagination’s boundless and trackless waste, into the safe fold of common sense.<p></p> <p></p> Arraigned at my own bar, Memory having given her evidence of the hopes, wishes, sentiments I had been cher-ishing since last night—of the general state of mind in which I had indulged for nearly a fortnight past; Reason having come forward and told, in her own quiet way a plain, unvarnished tale, showing how I had rejected the real, and rabidly devoured the ideal;—I pronounced judgment to this effect:-<p></p> <p></p> That a greater fool than Jane Eyre had never breathed the breath of life; that a more fantastic idiot had never surfeit-ed herself on sweet lies, and swallowed poison as if it were nectar.<p></p> <p></p> ‘YOU,’ I said, ‘a favourite with Mr. Rochester? YOU gift-ed with the power of pleasing him? YOU of importance to him in any way? Go! your folly sickens me. And you have derived pleasure from occasional tokens of preference— equivocal tokens shown by a gentleman of family and a man of the world to a dependent and a novice. How dared you? Poor stupid dupe!—Could not even self- interest make<p></p>

you wiser? You repeated to yourself this morning the brief scene of last night?—Cover your face and be ashamed! He said something in praise of your eyes, did he? Blind pup-py! Open their bleared lids and look on your own accursed senselessness! It does good to no woman to be flattered by her superior, who cannot possibly intend to marry her; and it is madness in all women to let a secret love kindle within them, which, if unreturned and unknown, must devour the life that feeds it; and, if discovered and responded to, must lead, ignis-fatus-like, into miry wilds whence there is no ex-trication.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Listen, then, Jane Eyre, to your sentence: tomorrow, place the glass before you, and draw in chalk your own pic-ture, faithfully, without softening one defect; omit no harsh line, smooth away no displeasing irregularity; write under it, ‘Portrait of a Governess, disconnected, poor, and plain.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Afterwards, take a piece of smooth ivory—you have one prepared in your drawing-box: take your palette, mix your freshest, finest, clearest tints; choose your most delicate camel-hair pencils; delineate carefully the loveliest face you can imagine; paint it in your softest shades and sweetest lines, according to the description given by Mrs. Fairfax of Blanche Ingram; remember the raven ringlets, the oriental eye;—What! you revert to Mr. Rochester as a model! Order! No snivel!—no sentiment!—no regret! I will endure only sense and resolution. Recall the august yet harmonious lineaments, the Grecian neck and bust; let the round and dazzling arm be visible, and the delicate hand; omit neither diamond ring nor gold bracelet; portray faithfully the attire,<p></p>

aerial lace and glistening satin, graceful scarf and golden rose; call it ‘Blanche, an accomplished lady of rank.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Whenever, in future, you should chance to fancy Mr. Rochester thinks well of you, take out these two pictures and compare them: say, ‘Mr. Rochester might probably win that noble lady’s love, if he chose to strive for it; is it likely he would waste a serious thought on this indigent and in-significant plebeian?’’<p></p> <p></p> ‘I’ll do it,’ I resolved: and having framed this determina-tion, I grew calm, and fell asleep.<p></p> <p></p> I kept my word. An hour or two sufficed to sketch my own portrait in crayons; and in less than a fortnight I had completed an ivory miniature of an imaginary Blanche In-gram. It looked a lovely face enough, and when compared with the real head in chalk, the contrast was as great as self-control could desire. I derived benefit from the task: it had kept my head and hands employed, and had given force and fixedness to the new impressions I wished to stamp indel-ibly on my heart.<p></p> <p></p> Ere long, I had reason to congratulate myself on the course of wholesome discipline to which I had thus forced my feelings to submit. Thanks to it, I was able to meet sub-sequent occurrences with a decent calm, which, had they found me unprepared, I should probably have been unequal to maintain, even externally.<p></p>

Chapter XVII<p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> Aweek passed, and no news arrived of Mr. Roches-ter: ten days, and still he did not come. Mrs. Fairfax said she should not be surprised if he were to go straight from the Leas to London, and thence to the Continent, and not show his face again at Thornfield for a year to come; he had not unfrequently quitted it in a manner quite as abrupt and unexpected. When I heard this, I was begin-ning to feel a strange chill and failing at the heart. I was actually permitting myself to experience a sickening sense of disappointment; but rallying my wits, and recollecting my principles, I at once called my sensations to order; and it was wonderful how I got over the temporary blunder— how I cleared up the mistake of supposing Mr. Rochester’s movements a matter in which I had any cause to take a vital interest. Not that I humbled myself by a slavish notion of<p></p> <p></p> inferiority: on the contrary, I just said—<p></p> <p></p> ‘You have nothing to do with the master of Thornfield, further than to receive the salary he gives you for teach-ing his protegee, and to be grateful for such respectful and kind treatment as, if you do your duty, you have a right to expect at his hands. Be sure that is the only tie he seriously acknowledges between you and him; so don’t make him the object of your fine feelings, your raptures, agonies, and so forth. He is not of your order: keep to your caste, and be too<p></p>  
<p></p> 246	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
self-respecting to lavish the love of the whole heart, soul, and strength, where such a gift is not wanted and would be despised.’<p></p> <p></p> I went on with my day’s business tranquilly; but ever and anon vague suggestions kept wandering across my brain of reasons why I should quit Thornfield; and I kept involun-tarily framing advertisements and pondering conjectures about new situations: these thoughts I did not think check; they might germinate and bear fruit if they could.<p></p> <p></p> Mr. Rochester had been absent upwards of a fortnight, when the post brought Mrs. Fairfax a letter.<p></p> <p></p> ‘It is from the master,’ said she, as she looked at the di-rection. ‘Now I suppose we shall know whether we are to expect his return or not.’<p></p> <p></p> And while she broke the seal and perused the document, I went on taking my coffee (we were at breakfast): it was hot, and I attributed to that circumstance a fiery glow which suddenly rose to my face. Why my hand shook, and why I involuntarily spilt half the contents of my cup into my sau-cer, I did not choose to consider.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Well, I sometimes think we are too quiet; but we run a chance of being busy enough now: for a little while at least,’ said Mrs. Fairfax, still holding the note before her specta-cles.<p></p> <p></p> Ere I permitted myself to request an explanation, I tied the string of Adele’s pinafore, which happened to be loose: having helped her also to another bun and refilled her mug with milk, I said, nonchalantly—<p></p> <p></p> ‘Mr. Rochester is not likely to return soon, I suppose?’<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	247<p></p>  
‘Indeed he is—in three days, he says: that will be next Thursday; and not alone either. I don’t know how many of the fine people at the Leas are coming with him: he sends directions for all the best bedrooms to be prepared; and the library and drawing-rooms are to be cleaned out; I am to get more kitchen hands from the George Inn, at Millcote, and from wherever else I can; and the ladies will bring their maids and the gentlemen their valets: so we shall have a full house of it.’ And Mrs. Fairfax swallowed her breakfast and hastened away to commence operations.<p></p> <p></p> The three days were, as she had foretold, busy enough. I had thought all the rooms at Thornfield beautifully clean and well arranged; but it appears I was mistaken. Three women were got to help; and such scrubbing, such brushing, such washing of paint and beating of carpets, such taking down and putting up of pictures, such polishing of mirrors and lustres, such lighting of fires in bedrooms, such airing of sheets and feather-beds on hearths, I never beheld, ei-ther before or since. Adele ran quite wild in the midst of it: the preparations for company and the prospect of their arrival, seemed to throw her into ecstasies. She would have Sophie to look over all her ‘toilettes,’ as she called frocks; to furbish up any that were ‘passees,’ and to air and arrange the new. For herself, she did nothing but caper about in the front chambers, jump on and off the bedsteads, and lie on the mattresses and piled-up bolsters and pillows before the enormous fires roaring in the chimneys. From school du-ties she was exonerated: Mrs. Fairfax had pressed me into her service, and I was all day in the storeroom, helping (or<p></p>  
<p></p> 248	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
hindering) her and the cook; learning to make custards and cheese-cakes and French pastry, to truss game and garnish desert-dishes.<p></p> <p></p> The party were expected to arrive on Thursday afternoon, in time for dinner at six. During the intervening period I had no time to nurse chimeras; and I believe I was as active and gay as anybody—Adele excepted. Still, now and then, I received a damping check to my cheerfulness; and was, in spite of myself, thrown back on the region of doubts and portents, and dark conjectures. This was when I chanced to see the third-storey staircase door (which of late had al-ways been kept locked) open slowly, and give passage to the form of Grace Poole, in prim cap, white apron, and hand-kerchief; when I watched her glide along the gallery, her quiet tread muffled in a list slipper; when I saw her look into the bustling, topsy-turvy bedrooms,—just say a word, perhaps, to the charwoman about the proper way to polish a grate, or clean a marble mantelpiece, or take stains from papered walls, and then pass on. She would thus descend to the kitchen once a day, eat her dinner, smoke a moderate pipe on the hearth, and go back, carrying her pot of porter with her, for her private solace, in her own gloomy, upper haunt. Only one hour in the twenty-four did she pass with her fellow-servants below; all the rest of her time was spent in some low-ceiled, oaken chamber of the second storey: there she sat and sewed—and probably laughed drearily to herself,—as companionless as a prisoner in his dungeon.<p></p> <p></p> The strangest thing of all was, that not a soul in the house, except me, noticed her habits, or seemed to marvel at them:<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	249<p></p>  
no one discussed her position or employment; no one pitied her solitude or isolation. I once, indeed, overheard part of a dialogue between Leah and one of the charwomen, of which Grace formed the subject. Leah had been saying something I had not caught, and the charwoman remarked—<p></p> <p></p> ‘She gets good wages, I guess?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Yes,’ said Leah; ‘I wish I had as good; not that mine are to complain of,—there’s no stinginess at Thornfield; but they’re not one fifth of the sum Mrs. Poole receives. And she is laying by: she goes every quarter to the bank at Millcote. I should not wonder but she has saved enough to keep her in-dependent if she liked to leave; but I suppose she’s got used to the place; and then she’s not forty yet, and strong and able for anything. It is too soon for her to give up business.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘She is a good hand, I daresay,’ said the charwoman. ‘Ah!—she understands what she has to do,—nobody bet-<p></p> <p></p> ter,’ rejoined Leah significantly; ‘and it is not every one could fill her shoes— not for all the money she gets.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘That it is not!’ was the reply. ‘I wonder whether the mas-ter—‘<p></p> <p></p> The charwoman was going on; but here Leah turned and perceived me, and she instantly gave her companion a nudge.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Doesn’t she know?’ I heard the woman whisper.<p></p> <p></p> Leah shook her head, and the conversation was of course dropped. All I had gathered from it amounted to this,—that there was a mystery at Thornfield; and that from participa-tion in that mystery I was purposely excluded.<p></p> <p></p> Thursday came: all work had been completed the pre-<p></p>  
<p></p> 250	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
vious evening; carpets were laid down, bed-hangings festooned, radiant white counterpanes spread, toilet ta-bles arranged, furniture rubbed, flowers piled in vases: both chambers and saloons looked as fresh and bright as hands could make them. The hall, too, was scoured; and the great carved clock, as well as the steps and banisters of the staircase, were polished to the brightness of glass; in the dining-room, the sideboard flashed resplendent with plate; in the drawing-room and boudoir, vases of exotics bloomed on all sides.<p></p> <p></p> Afternoon arrived: Mrs. Fairfax assumed her best black satin gown, her gloves, and her gold watch; for it was her part to receive the company,—to conduct the ladies to their rooms, &c. Adele, too, would be dressed: though I thought she had little chance of being introduced to the party that day at least. However, to please her, I allowed Sophie to ap-parel her in one of her short, full muslin frocks. For myself, I had no need to make any change; I should not be called upon to quit my sanctum of the schoolroom; for a sanctum it was now become to me,—‘a very pleasant refuge in time of trouble.’<p></p> <p></p> It had been a mild, serene spring day—one of those days which, towards the end of March or the beginning of April, rise shining over the earth as heralds of summer. It was drawing to an end now; but the evening was even warm, and I sat at work in the schoolroom with the window open.<p></p> <p></p> ‘It gets late,’ said Mrs. Fairfax, entering in rustling state. ‘I am glad I ordered dinner an hour after the time Mr. Roch-ester mentioned; for it is past six now. I have sent John down<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	251<p></p>  
to the gates to see if there is anything on the road: one can see a long way from thence in the direction of Millcote.’ She went to the window. ‘Here he is!’ said she. ‘Well, John’ (lean-ing out), ‘any news?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘They’re coming, ma’am,’ was the answer. ‘They’ll be here in ten minutes.’<p></p> <p></p> Adele flew to the window. I followed, taking care to stand on one side, so that, screened by the curtain, I could see without being seen.<p></p> <p></p> The ten minutes John had given seemed very long, but at last wheels were heard; four equestrians galloped up the drive, and after them came two open carriages. Fluttering veils and waving plumes filled the vehicles; two of the cava-liers were young, dashing-looking gentlemen; the third was Mr. Rochester, on his black horse, Mesrour, Pilot bound-ing before him; at his side rode a lady, and he and she were the first of the party. Her purple riding-habit almost swept the ground, her veil streamed long on the breeze; mingling with its transparent folds, and gleaming through them, shone rich raven ringlets.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Miss Ingram!’ exclaimed Mrs. Fairfax, and away she hurried to her post below.<p></p> <p></p> The cavalcade, following the sweep of the drive, quickly turned the angle of the house, and I lost sight of it. Adele now petitioned to go down; but I took her on my knee, and gave her to understand that she must not on any account think of venturing in sight of the ladies, either now or at any other time, unless expressly sent for: that Mr. Rochester would be very angry, &c. ‘Some natural tears she shed’ on<p></p>  
<p></p> 252	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
being told this; but as I began to look very grave, she con-sented at last to wipe them.<p></p> <p></p> A joyous stir was now audible in the hall: gentlemen’s deep tones and ladies’ silvery accents blent harmoniously together, and distinguishable above all, though not loud, was the sonorous voice of the master of Thornfield Hall, wel-coming his fair and gallant guests under its roof. Then light steps ascended the stairs; and there was a tripping through the gallery, and soft cheerful laughs, and opening and clos-ing doors, and, for a time, a hush.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Elles changent de toilettes,’ said Adele; who, listening at-tentively, had followed every movement; and she sighed.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Chez maman,’ said she, ‘quand il y avait du monde, je le suivais partout, au salon et e leurs chambres; souvent je re-gardais les femmes de chambre coiffer et habiller les dames, et c’etait si amusant: comme cela on apprend.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Don’t you feel hungry, Adele?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Mais oui, mademoiselle: voile cinq ou six heures que nous n’avons pas mange.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Well now, while the ladies are in their rooms, I will ven-ture down and get you something to eat.’<p></p> <p></p> And issuing from my asylum with precaution, I sought a back-stairs which conducted directly to the kitchen. All in that region was fire and commotion; the soup and fish were in the last stage of projection, and the cook hung over her crucibles in a frame of mind and body threatening sponta-neous combustion. In the servants’ hall two coachmen and three gentlemen’s gentlemen stood or sat round the fire; the abigails, I suppose, were upstairs with their mistresses;<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	253<p></p>  
the new servants, that had been hired from Millcote, were bustling about everywhere. Threading this chaos, I at last reached the larder; there I took possession of a cold chicken, a roll of bread, some tarts, a plate or two and a knife and fork: with this booty I made a hasty retreat. I had regained the gallery, and was just shutting the back-door behind me, when an accelerated hum warned me that the ladies were about to issue from their chambers. I could not proceed to the schoolroom without passing some of their doors, and running the risk of being surprised with my cargo of vict-ualage; so I stood still at this end, which, being windowless, was dark: quite dark now, for the sun was set and twilight gathering.<p></p> <p></p> Presently the chambers gave up their fair tenants one af-ter another: each came out gaily and airily, with dress that gleamed lustrous through the dusk. For a moment they stood grouped together at the other extremity of the gallery, conversing in a key of sweet subdued vivacity: they then de-scended the staircase almost as noiselessly as a bright mist rolls down a hill. Their collective appearance had left on me an impression of high-born elegance, such as I had never before received.<p></p> <p></p> I found Adele peeping through the schoolroom door, which she held ajar. ‘What beautiful ladies!’ cried she in English. ‘Oh, I wish I might go to them! Do you think Mr. Rochester will send for us by- and-bye, after dinner?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘No, indeed, I don’t; Mr. Rochester has something else to think about. Never mind the ladies to-night; perhaps you will see them to-morrow: here is your dinner.’<p></p>  
<p></p> 254	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
She was really hungry, so the chicken and tarts served to divert her attention for a time. It was well I secured this for-age, or both she, I, and Sophie, to whom I conveyed a share of our repast, would have run a chance of getting no dinner at all: every one downstairs was too much engaged to think of us. The dessert was not carried out till after nine and at ten footmen were still running to and fro with trays and coffee- cups. I allowed Adele to sit up much later than usual; for she declared she could not possibly go to sleep while the doors kept opening and shutting below, and people bustling about. Besides, she added, a message might possibly come from Mr. Rochester when she was undressed; ‘et alors quel dommage!’<p></p> <p></p> I told her stories as long as she would listen to them; and then for a change I took her out into the gallery. The hall lamp was now lit, and it amused her to look over the balustrade and watch the servants passing backwards and forwards. When the evening was far advanced, a sound of music issued from the drawing-room, whither the piano had been removed; Adele and I sat down on the top step of the stairs to listen. Presently a voice blent with the rich tones of the instrument; it was a lady who sang, and very sweet her notes were. The solo over, a duet followed, and then a glee: a joyous conversational murmur filled up the inter-vals. I listened long: suddenly I discovered that my ear was wholly intent on analysing the mingled sounds, and trying to discriminate amidst the confusion of accents those of Mr. Rochester; and when it caught them, which it soon did, it found a further task in framing the tones, rendered by dis-<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	255<p></p>  
tance inarticulate, into words.<p></p> <p></p> The clock struck eleven. I looked at Adele, whose head leant against my shoulder; her eyes were waxing heavy, so I took her up in my arms and carried her off to bed. It was near one before the gentlemen and ladies sought their chambers.<p></p> <p></p> The next day was as fine as its predecessor: it was devoted by the party to an excursion to some site in the neighbour-hood. They set out early in the forenoon, some on horseback, the rest in carriages; I witnessed both the departure and the return. Miss Ingram, as before, was the only lady equestri-an; and, as before, Mr. Rochester galloped at her side; the two rode a little apart from the rest. I pointed out this cir-cumstance to Mrs. Fairfax, who was standing at the window with me—<p></p> <p></p> ‘You said it was not likely they should think of being married,’ said I, ‘but you see Mr. Rochester evidently pre-fers her to any of the other ladies.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Yes, I daresay: no doubt he admires her.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘And she him,’ I added; ‘look how she leans her head to-wards him as if she were conversing confidentially; I wish I could see her face; I have never had a glimpse of it yet.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘You will see her this evening,’ answered Mrs. Fairfax. ‘I happened to remark to Mr. Rochester how much Adele wished to be introduced to the ladies, and he said: ‘Oh! let her come into the drawing-room after dinner; and request Miss Eyre to accompany her.’’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Yes; he said that from mere politeness: I need not go, I am sure,’ I answered.<p></p>  
<p></p> 256	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
‘Well, I observed to him that as you were unused to com-pany, I did not think you would like appearing before so gay a party—all strangers; and he replied, in his quick way— ‘Nonsense! If she objects, tell her it is my particular wish; and if she resists, say I shall come and fetch her in case of contumacy.’’<p></p> <p></p> ‘I will not give him that trouble,’ I answered. ‘I will go, if no better may be; but I don’t like it. Shall you be there, Mrs. Fairfax?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘No; I pleaded off, and he admitted my plea. I’ll tell you how to manage so as to avoid the embarrassment of mak-ing a formal entrance, which is the most disagreeable part of the business. You must go into the drawing-room while it is empty, before the ladies leave the dinner-table; choose your seat in any quiet nook you like; you need not stay long after the gentlemen come in, unless you please: just let Mr. Rochester see you are there and then slip away—nobody will notice you.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Will these people remain long, do you think?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Perhaps two or three weeks, certainly not more. After the Easter recess, Sir George Lynn, who was lately elected member for Millcote, will have to go up to town and take his seat; I daresay Mr. Rochester will accompany him: it surprises me that he has already made so protracted a stay at Thornfield.’<p></p> <p></p> It was with some trepidation that I perceived the hour approach when I was to repair with my charge to the draw-ing-room. Adele had been in a state of ecstasy all day, after hearing she was to be presented to the ladies in the eve-<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	257<p></p>  
ning; and it was not till Sophie commenced the operation of dressing her that she sobered down. Then the importance of the process quickly steadied her, and by the time she had her curls arranged in well-smoothed, drooping clusters, her pink satin frock put on, her long sash tied, and her lace mit-tens adjusted, she looked as grave as any judge. No need to warn her not to disarrange her attire: when she was dressed, she sat demurely down in her little chair, taking care pre-viously to lift up the satin skirt for fear she should crease it, and assured me she would not stir thence till I was ready. This I quickly was: my best dress (the silver-grey one, pur-chased for Miss Temple’s wedding, and never worn since) was soon put on; my hair was soon smoothed; my sole orna-ment, the pearl brooch, soon assumed. We descended.<p></p> <p></p> Fortunately there was another entrance to the draw-ing-room than that through the saloon where they were all seated at dinner. We found the apartment vacant; a large fire burning silently on the marble hearth, and wax candles shining in bright solitude, amid the exquisite flowers with which the tables were adorned. The crimson curtain hung before the arch: slight as was the separation this drapery formed from the party in the adjoining saloon, they spoke in so low a key that nothing of their conversation could be distinguished beyond a soothing murmur.<p></p> <p></p> Adele, who appeared to be still under the influence of a most solemnising impression, sat down, without a word, on the footstool I pointed out to her. I retired to a window-seat, and taking a book from a table near, endeavoured to read. Adele brought her stool to my feet; ere long she touched my<p></p>  
<p></p> 258	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
knee.<p></p> <p></p> ‘What is it, Adele?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Est-ce que je ne puis pas prendrie une seule de ces fleurs magnifiques, mademoiselle? Seulement pour completer ma toilette.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘You think too much of your ‘toilette,’ Adele: but you may have a flower.’ And I took a rose from a vase and fastened it in her sash. She sighed a sigh of ineffable satisfaction, as if her cup of happiness were now full. I turned my face away to conceal a smile I could not suppress: there was some-thing ludicrous as well as painful in the little Parisienne’s earnest and innate devotion to matters of dress.<p></p> <p></p> A soft sound of rising now became audible; the curtain was swept back from the arch; through it appeared the din-ing-room, with its lit lustre pouring down light on the silver and glass of a magnificent dessert-service covering a long table; a band of ladies stood in the opening; they entered, and the curtain fell behind them.<p></p> <p></p> There were but eight; yet, somehow, as they flocked in, they gave the impression of a much larger number. Some of them were very tall; many were dressed in white; and all had a sweeping amplitude of array that seemed to magnify their persons as a mist magnifies the moon. I rose and curt-seyed to them: one or two bent their heads in return, the others only stared at me.<p></p> <p></p> They dispersed about the room, reminding me, by the lightness and buoyancy of their movements, of a flock of white plumy birds. Some of them threw themselves in half-reclining positions on the sofas and ottomans: some bent<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	259<p></p>  
over the tables and examined the flowers and books: the<p></p> <p></p> rest gathered in a group round the fire: all talked in a low but clear tone which seemed habitual to them. I knew their names afterwards, and may as well mention them now.<p></p> <p></p> First, there was Mrs. Eshton and two of her daughters. She had evidently been a handsome woman, and was well preserved still. Of her daughters, the eldest, Amy, was rather little: naive, and child-like in face and manner, and piquant in form; her white muslin dress and blue sash became her well. The second, Louisa, was taller and more elegant in fig-ure; with a very pretty face, of that order the French term minois chiffone: both sisters were fair as lilies.<p></p> <p></p> Lady Lynn was a large and stout personage of about forty, very erect, very haughty-looking, richly dressed in a satin robe of changeful sheen: her dark hair shone glossily un-der the shade of an azure plume, and within the circlet of a band of gems.<p></p> <p></p> Mrs. Colonel Dent was less showy; but, I thought, more lady-like. She had a slight figure, a pale, gentle face, and fair hair. Her black satin dress, her scarf of rich foreign lace, and her pearl ornaments, pleased me better than the rainbow radiance of the titled dame.<p></p> <p></p> But the three most distinguished—partly, perhaps, be-cause the tallest figures of the band—were the Dowager Lady Ingram and her daughters, Blanche and Mary. They were all three of the loftiest stature of women. The Dowager might be between forty and fifty: her shape was still fine; her hair (by candle-light at least) still black; her teeth, too, were still apparently perfect. Most people would have termed her a<p></p>  
<p></p> 260	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
splendid woman of her age: and so she was, no doubt, physi-cally speaking; but then there was an expression of almost insupportable haughtiness in her bearing and countenance. She had Roman features and a double chin, disappearing into a throat like a pillar: these features appeared to me not only inflated and darkened, but even furrowed with pride; and the chin was sustained by the same principle, in a po-sition of almost preternatural erectness. She had, likewise, a fierce and a hard eye: it reminded me of Mrs. Reed’s; she mouthed her words in speaking; her voice was deep, its in-flections very pompous, very dogmatical,—very intolerable, in short. A crimson velvet robe, and a shawl turban of some gold-wrought Indian fabric, invested her (I suppose she thought) with a truly imperial dignity.<p></p> <p></p> Blanche and Mary were of equal stature,—straight and tall as poplars. Mary was too slim for her height, but Blanche was moulded like a Dian. I regarded her, of course, with spe-cial interest. First, I wished to see whether her appearance accorded with Mrs. Fairfax’s description; secondly, whether it at all resembled the fancy miniature I had painted of her; and thirdly—it will out!— whether it were such as I should fancy likely to suit Mr. Rochester’s taste.<p></p> <p></p> As far as person went, she answered point for point, both to my picture and Mrs. Fairfax’s description. The noble bust, the sloping shoulders, the graceful neck, the dark eyes and black ringlets were all there;—but her face? Her face was like her mother’s; a youthful unfurrowed likeness: the same low brow, the same high features, the same pride. It was not, however, so saturnine a pride! she laughed continually; her<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	261<p></p>  
laugh was satirical, and so was the habitual expression of her arched and haughty lip.<p></p> <p></p> Genius is said to be self- conscious. I cannot tell whether Miss Ingram was a genius, but she was self-conscious—re-markably self- conscious indeed. She entered into a discourse on botany with the gentle Mrs. Dent. It seemed Mrs. Dent had not studied that science: though, as she said, she liked flowers, ‘especially wild ones;’ Miss Ingram had, and she ran over its vocabulary with an air. I presently perceived she was (what is vernacularly termed) TRAILING Mrs. Dent; that is, playing on her ignorance—her TRAIL might be clever, but it was decidedly not good-natured. She played: her execution was brilliant; she sang: her voice was fine; she talked French apart to her mamma; and she talked it well, with fluency and with a good accent.<p></p> <p></p> Mary had a milder and more open countenance than Blanche; softer features too, and a skin some shades fair-er (Miss Ingram was dark as a Spaniard)—but Mary was deficient in life: her face lacked expression, her eye lustre; she had nothing to say, and having once taken her seat, re-mained fixed like a statue in its niche. The sisters were both attired in spotless white.<p></p> <p></p> And did I now think Miss Ingram such a choice as Mr. Rochester would be likely to make? I could not tell—I did not know his taste in female beauty. If he liked the majestic, she was the very type of majesty: then she was accomplished, sprightly. Most gentlemen would admire her, I thought; and that he DID admire her, I already seemed to have obtained proof: to remove the last shade of doubt, it remained but to<p></p>  
<p></p> 262	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
see them together.<p></p> <p></p> You are not to suppose, reader, that Adele has all this time been sitting motionless on the stool at my feet: no; when the ladies entered, she rose, advanced to meet them, made a stately reverence, and said with gravity—<p></p> <p></p> ‘Bon jour, mesdames.’<p></p> <p></p> And Miss Ingram had looked down at her with a mock-ing air, and exclaimed, ‘Oh, what a little puppet!’<p></p> <p></p> Lady Lynn had remarked, ‘It is Mr. Rochester’s ward, I suppose—the little French girl he was speaking of.’<p></p> <p></p> Mrs. Dent had kindly taken her hand, and given her a kiss.<p></p> <p></p> Amy and Louisa Eshton had cried out simultaneously— ‘What a love of a child!’<p></p> <p></p> And then they had called her to a sofa, where she now sat, ensconced between them, chattering alternately in French and broken English; absorbing not only the young ladies’ attention, but that of Mrs. Eshton and Lady Lynn, and get-ting spoilt to her heart’s content.<p></p> <p></p> At last coffee is brought in, and the gentlemen are sum-moned. I sit in the shade—if any shade there be in this brilliantly-lit apartment; the window- curtain half hides me. Again the arch yawns; they come. The collective appearance of the gentlemen, like that of the ladies, is very imposing: they are all costumed in black; most of them are tall, some young. Henry and Frederick Lynn are very dashing sparks indeed; and Colonel Dent is a fine soldierly man. Mr. Esh-ton, the magistrate of the district, is gentleman-like: his hair is quite white, his eyebrows and whiskers still dark, which<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	263<p></p>  
gives him something of the appearance of a ‘pere noble de theatre.’ Lord Ingram, like his sisters, is very tall; like them, also, he is handsome; but he shares Mary’s apathetic and listless look: he seems to have more length of limb than vi-vacity of blood or vigour of brain.<p></p> <p></p> And where is Mr. Rochester?<p></p> <p></p> He comes in last: I am not looking at the arch, yet I see him enter. I try to concentrate my attention on those net-ting-needles, on the meshes of the purse I am forming—I wish to think only of the work I have in my hands, to see only the silver beads and silk threads that lie in my lap; whereas, I distinctly behold his figure, and I inevitably re-call the moment when I last saw it; just after I had rendered him, what he deemed, an essential service, and he, hold-ing my hand, and looking down on my face, surveyed me with eyes that revealed a heart full and eager to overflow; in whose emotions I had a part. How near had I approached him at that moment! What had occurred since, calculated to change his and my relative positions? Yet now, how dis-tant, how far estranged we were! So far estranged, that I did not expect him to come and speak to me. I did not wonder, when, without looking at me, he took a seat at the other side of the room, and began conversing with some of the ladies.<p></p> <p></p> No sooner did I see that his attention was riveted on them, and that I might gaze without being observed, than my eyes were drawn involuntarily to his face; I could not keep their lids under control: they would rise, and the irids would fix on him. I looked, and had an acute pleasure in looking,—a precious yet poignant pleasure; pure gold, with<p></p>  
<p></p> 264	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
a steely point of agony: a pleasure like what the thirst-per-ishing man might feel who knows the well to which he has crept is poisoned, yet stoops and drinks divine draughts nevertheless.<p></p> <p></p> Most true is it that ‘beauty is in the eye of the gazer.’ My master’s colourless, olive face, square, massive brow, broad and jetty eyebrows, deep eyes, strong features, firm, grim mouth,—all energy, decision, will,—were not beautiful, ac-cording to rule; but they were more than beautiful to me; they were full of an interest, an influence that quite mas-tered me,—that took my feelings from my own power and fettered them in his. I had not intended to love him; the reader knows I had wrought hard to extirpate from my soul the germs of love there detected; and now, at the first re-newed view of him, they spontaneously arrived, green and strong! He made me love him without looking at me.<p></p> <p></p> I compared him with his guests. What was the gallant grace of the Lynns, the languid elegance of Lord Ingram,— even the military distinction of Colonel Dent, contrasted with his look of native pith and genuine power? I had no sympathy in their appearance, their expression: yet I could imagine that most observers would call them attractive, handsome, imposing; while they would pronounce Mr. Rochester at once harsh-featured and melancholy-looking. I saw them smile, laugh—it was nothing; the light of the candles had as much soul in it as their smile; the tinkle of the bell as much significance as their laugh. I saw Mr. Roch-ester smile:- his stern features softened; his eye grew both brilliant and gentle, its ray both searching and sweet. He<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	265<p></p>  
was talking, at the moment, to Louisa and Amy Eshton. I wondered to see them receive with calm that look which seemed to me so penetrating: I expected their eyes to fall, their colour to rise under it; yet I was glad when I found they were in no sense moved. ‘He is not to them what he is to me,’ I thought: ‘he is not of their kind. I believe he is of mine;—I am sure he is—I feel akin to him—I understand the lan-guage of his countenance and movements: though rank and wealth sever us widely, I have something in my brain and heart, in my blood and nerves, that assimilates me mentally to him. Did I say, a few days since, that I had nothing to do with him but to receive my salary at his hands? Did I forbid myself to think of him in any other light than as a paymas-ter? Blasphemy against nature! Every good, true, vigorous feeling I have gathers impulsively round him. I know I must conceal my sentiments: I must smother hope; I must re-member that he cannot care much for me. For when I say that I am of his kind, I do not mean that I have his force to influence, and his spell to attract; I mean only that I have certain tastes and feelings in common with him. I must, then, repeat continually that we are for ever sundered:- and yet, while I breathe and think, I must love him.’<p></p> <p></p> Coffee is handed. The ladies, since the gentlemen en-tered, have become lively as larks; conversation waxes brisk and merry. Colonel Dent and Mr. Eshton argue on politics; their wives listen. The two proud dowagers, Lady Lynn and Lady Ingram, confabulate together. Sir George—whom, by-the-bye, I have forgotten to describe,—a very big, and very fresh-looking country gentleman, stands before their sofa,<p></p>  
<p></p> 266	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
coffee-cup in hand, and occasionally puts in a word. Mr. Frederick Lynn has taken a seat beside Mary Ingram, and is showing her the engravings of a splendid volume: she looks, smiles now and then, but apparently says little. The tall and phlegmatic Lord Ingram leans with folded arms on the chair-back of the little and lively Amy Eshton; she glanc-es up at him, and chatters like a wren: she likes him better than she does Mr. Rochester. Henry Lynn has taken posses-sion of an ottoman at the feet of Louisa: Adele shares it with him: he is trying to talk French with her, and Louisa laughs at his blunders. With whom will Blanche Ingram pair? She is standing alone at the table, bending gracefully over an al-bum. She seems waiting to be sought; but she will not wait too long: she herself selects a mate.<p></p> <p></p> Mr. Rochester, having quitted the Eshtons, stands on the hearth as solitary as she stands by the table: she confronts him, taking her station on the opposite side of the mantel-piece.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Mr. Rochester, I thought you were not fond of children?’ ‘Nor am I.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Then, what induced you to take charge of such a little doll as that?’ (pointing to Adele). ‘Where did you pick her up?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘I did not pick her up; she was left on my hands.’ ‘You should have sent her to school.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘I could not afford it: schools are so dear.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Why, I suppose you have a governess for her: I saw a person with her just now—is she gone? Oh, no! there she is still, behind the window-curtain. You pay her, of course; I<p></p>

should think it quite as expensive,—more so; for you have them both to keep in addition.’<p></p> <p></p> I feared—or should I say, hoped?—the allusion to me would make Mr. Rochester glance my way; and I involun-tarily shrank farther into the shade: but he never turned his eyes.<p></p> <p></p> ‘I have not considered the subject,’ said he indifferently, looking straight before him.<p></p> <p></p> ‘No, you men never do consider economy and common sense. You should hear mama on the Chapter of governesses: Mary and I have had, I should think, a dozen at least in our day; half of them detestable and the rest ridiculous, and all incubi—were they not, mama?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Did you speak, my own?’<p></p> <p></p> The young lady thus claimed as the dowager’s special property, reiterated her question with an explanation.<p></p> <p></p> ‘My dearest, don’t mention governesses; the word makes me nervous. I have suffered a martyrdom from their incom-petency and caprice. I thank Heaven I have now done with them!’<p></p> <p></p> Mrs. Dent here bent over to the pious lady and whispered something in her ear; I suppose, from the answer elicited, it was a reminder that one of the anathematised race was present.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Tant pis!’ said her Ladyship, ‘I hope it may do her good!’ Then, in a lower tone, but still loud enough for me to hear, ‘I noticed her; I am a judge of physiognomy, and in hers I see all the faults of her class.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘What are they, madam?’ inquired Mr. Rochester aloud.<p></p>  
<p></p> 268	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
‘I will tell you in your private ear,’ replied she, wagging her turban three times with portentous significancy.<p></p> <p></p> ‘But my curiosity will be past its appetite; it craves food now.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Ask Blanche; she is nearer you than I.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Oh, don’t refer him to me, mama! I have just one word to say of the whole tribe; they are a nuisance. Not that I ever suffered much from them; I took care to turn the ta-bles. What tricks Theodore and I used to play on our Miss Wilsons, and Mrs. Greys, and Madame Jouberts! Mary was always too sleepy to join in a plot with spirit. The best fun was with Madame Joubert: Miss Wilson was a poor sickly thing, lachrymose and low-spirited, not worth the trouble of vanquishing, in short; and Mrs. Grey was coarse and insensible; no blow took effect on her. But poor Madame Joubert! I see her yet in her raging passions, when we had driven her to extremities—spilt our tea, crumbled our bread and butter, tossed our books up to the ceiling, and played a charivari with the ruler and desk, the fender and fire-irons. Theodore, do you remember those merry days?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Yaas, to be sure I do,’ drawled Lord Ingram; ‘and the poor old stick used to cry out ‘Oh you villains childs!’—and then we sermonised her on the presumption of attempting to teach such clever blades as we were, when she was herself so ignorant.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘We did; and, Tedo, you know, I helped you in prosecut-ing (or persecuting) your tutor, whey-faced Mr. Vining—the parson in the pip, as we used to call him. He and Miss Wil-son took the liberty of falling in love with each other—at<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	269<p></p>  
least Tedo and I thought so; we surprised sundry tender glances and sighs which we interpreted as tokens of ‘la belle passion,’ and I promise you the public soon had the ben-efit of our discovery; we employed it as a sort of lever to hoist our dead-weights from the house. Dear mama, there, as soon as she got an inkling of the business, found out that it was of an immoral tendency. Did you not, my lady-moth-er?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Certainly, my best. And I was quite right: depend on that: there are a thousand reasons why liaisons between governesses and tutors should never be tolerated a moment in any well-regulated house; firstly—‘<p></p> <p></p> ‘Oh, gracious, mama! Spare us the enumeration! Au reste, we all know them: danger of bad example to innocence of childhood; distractions and consequent neglect of duty on the part of the attached—mutual alliance and reliance; con-fidence thence resultinginsolence accompanying—mutiny and general blow-up. Am I right, Baroness Ingram, of In-gram Park?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘My lily-flower, you are right now, as always.’ ‘Then no more need be said: change the subject.’<p></p> <p></p> Amy Eshton, not hearing or not heeding this dictum, joined in with her soft, infantine tone: ‘Louisa and I used to quiz our governess too; but she was such a good creature, she would bear anything: nothing put her out. She was nev-er cross with us; was she, Louisa?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘No, never: we might do what we pleased; ransack her desk and her workbox, and turn her drawers inside out; and she was so good- natured, she would give as anything we<p></p>  
<p></p> 270	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
asked for.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘I suppose, now,’ said Miss Ingram, curling her lip sar-castically, ‘we shall have an abstract of the memoirs of all the governesses extant: in order to avert such a visitation, I again move the introduction of a new topic. Mr. Rochester, do you second my motion?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Madam, I support you on this point, as on every other.’ ‘Then on me be the onus of bringing it forward. Signior<p></p> <p></p> Eduardo, are you in voice to-night?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Donna Bianca, if you command it, I will be.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Then, signior, I lay on you my sovereign behest to fur-bish up your lungs and other vocal organs, as they will be wanted on my royal service.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Who would not be the Rizzio of so divine a Mary?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘A fig for Rizzio!’ cried she, tossing her head with all its curls, as she moved to the piano. ‘It is my opinion the fid-dler David must have been an insipid sort of fellow; I like black Bothwell better: to my mind a man is nothing without a spice of the devil in him; and history may say what it will of James Hepburn, but I have a notion, he was just the sort of wild, fierce, bandit hero whom I could have consented to gift with my hand.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Gentlemen, you hear! Now which of you most resembles Bothwell?’ cried Mr. Rochester.<p></p> <p></p> ‘I should say the preference lies with you,’ responded Col-onel Dent.<p></p> <p></p> ‘On my honour, I am much obliged to you,’ was the re-ply.<p></p> <p></p> Miss Ingram, who had now seated herself with proud<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	271<p></p>  
grace at the piano, spreading out her snowy robes in queenly amplitude, commenced a brilliant prelude; talking mean-time. She appeared to be on her high horse to-night; both her words and her air seemed intended to excite not only the admiration, but the amazement of her auditors: she was evidently bent on striking them as something very dashing and daring indeed.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Oh, I am so sick of the young men of the present day!’ exclaimed she, rattling away at the instrument. ‘Poor, puny things, not fit to stir a step beyond papa’s park gates: nor to go even so far without mama’s permission and guard-ianship! Creatures so absorbed in care about their pretty faces, and their white hands, and their small feet; as if a man had anything to do with beauty! As if loveliness were not the special prerogative of woman—her legitimate appa-nage and heritage! I grant an ugly WOMAN is a blot on the fair face of creation; but as to the GENTLEMEN, let them be solicitous to possess only strength and valour: let their motto be:- Hunt, shoot, and fight: the rest is not worth a fil-lip. Such should be my device, were I a man.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Whenever I marry,’ she continued after a pause which none interrupted, ‘I am resolved my husband shall not be a rival, but a foil to me. I will suffer no competitor near the throne; I shall exact an undivided homage: his devotions shall not be shared between me and the shape he sees in his mirror. Mr. Rochester, now sing, and I will play for you.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘I am all obedience,’ was the response.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Here then is a Corsair-song. Know that I doat on Cor-sairs; and for that reason, sing it con spirito.’<p></p>  
<p></p> 272	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
‘Commands from Miss Ingram’s lips would put spirit into a mug of milk and water.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Take care, then: if you don’t please me, I will shame you by showing how such things SHOULD be done.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘That is offering a premium on incapacity: I shall now en-deavour to fail.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Gardez-vous en bien! If you err wilfully, I shall devise a proportionate punishment.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Miss Ingram ought to be clement, for she has it in her power to inflict a chastisement beyond mortal endurance.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Ha! explain!’ commanded the lady.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Pardon me, madam: no need of explanation; your own fine sense must inform you that one of your frowns would be a sufficient substitute for capital punishment.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Sing!’ said she, and again touching the piano, she com-menced an accompaniment in spirited style.<p></p> <p></p> ‘Now is my time to slip away,’ thought I: but the tones that then severed the air arrested me. Mrs. Fairfax had said Mr. Rochester possessed a fine voice: he did—a mel-low, powerful bass, into which he threw his own feeling, his own force; finding a way through the ear to the heart, and there waking sensation strangely. I waited till the last deep and full vibration had expired—till the tide of talk, checked an instant, had resumed its flow; I then quitted my shel-tered corner and made my exit by the side- door, which was fortunately near. Thence a narrow passage led into the hall: in crossing it, I perceived my sandal was loose; I stopped to tie it, kneeling down for that purpose on the mat at the foot of the staircase. I heard the dining-room door unclose; a<p></p>  
<p></p> Free eBooks at Planet eBook.com	273<p></p>  
gentleman came out; rising hastily, I stood face to face with him: it was Mr. Rochester.<p></p> <p></p> ‘How do you do?’ he asked.<p></p> <p></p> ‘I am very well, sir.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Why did you not come and speak to me in the room?’<p></p> <p></p> I thought I might have retorted the question on him who put it: but I would not take that freedom. I answered—<p></p> <p></p> ‘I did not wish to disturb you, as you seemed engaged, sir.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘What have you been doing during my absence?’ ‘Nothing particular; teaching Adele as usual.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘And getting a good deal paler than you were—as I saw at first sight. What is the matter?’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Nothing at all, sir.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Did you take any cold that night you half drowned me?’ ‘Not she least.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘Return to the drawing-room: you are deserting too ear-ly.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘I am tired, sir.’<p></p> <p></p> He looked at me for a minute.<p></p> <p></p> ‘And a little depressed,’ he said. ‘What about? Tell me.’ ‘Nothing—nothing, sir. I am not depressed.’<p></p> <p></p> ‘But I affirm that you are: so much depressed that a few more words would bring tears to your eyes—indeed, they are there now, shining and swimming; and a bead has slipped from the lash and fallen on to the flag. If I had time, and was not in mortal dread of some prating prig of a servant passing, I would know what all this means. Well, to-night I excuse you; but understand that so long as my<p></p>  
<p></p> 274	Jane Eyre<p></p>  
visitors stay, I expect you to appear in the drawing-room ev-ery evening; it is my wish; don’t neglect it. Now go, and send Sophie for Adele. Good-night, my—‘ He stopped, bit his lip, and abruptly left me.<p></p>
